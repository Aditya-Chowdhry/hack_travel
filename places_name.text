The roads are very good and clean and fit every Tourist place they made good transportation facility. The main Tourist attraction is Ramoji film city which is really a best place where whatever  you expect everything is there. When I visited there was movie shooting of telugu movie.

In this city many places are superb specially char minaar and Ramoji film city both are incrediable.A city of great beauty, taste( the culinary tragedy)   and opportunities, that has high regard to the financial deficit we all are in now and then, undermined by people's lack of civic sense and their volatile nature. People fall out and could beat each other out of sheer folly. All of this I hope to delineate as I go further. I may be critical but will not overlook the fact that this is still a wonderful city that has an environment of growth.Recently I have visited Hyderabad (city of worse traffic). My dates were 23-Dec-2013 to 27-Dec-2013 (during Christmas vacations). I went by my own car and I went from Pune to Hyderabad. It was not a good experience as I guess due to road condition. It took almost 11 hours to reach 575 km.I very seriously think that I should be made the brand ambassador of Hyderabad. Oh, I have fallen in love with Hyderabad. I am a Mumbaiya and my spouse is a Delhiate, we keep on debating over which city is better amongst the two. But both of us have now very amicably agreed that bhai Hyderabad IS THE CITY. The weather or climate here is very pleasant almost all round the year. At least better than any other big city or metro. Being in India I find it one of the most clean cities of India. The roads  are broader, cleaner and maintained. And not to forget the somewhat mountainous roads, the slopes and the steeps and the microscopic views of the city that one comes across every now and then which are such pleasure when you are driving back from work. The cosmopolitan crowd, well behaved and well cultured Urdu speaking people make such good company. Arey Hyderabadi Hindi is not to be missed out .Hyderabad has it all food, culture, monuments of historic importance, beautiful landscapes, multiplexes, pubs, discs, hotels. You name it and you have it. This place is shopaholic's paradise, shoppers of every cadre will be happy here. This place can be toured around, trust me its not boring like other cities. The best part is cab taxi are so readily available here that shopping, going out to movies, touring around, airport and railway station pick and drop are no more an inconvenience. Waise, our personal favorite is cabonclick.com. They have best cabs for best rates and best service. Our experience with them have been very good.Being one of the oldest cultures in the world, Hyderabad, India is rich in culture and heritage. This fact is visible in tons of monuments, their ruins, buildings, temples, forts, palaces, tombs and caves all across India. Now it is time for "Mobile Motor Controller Company" to drink the blood of POOR/INNOCENT INDIAN FARMERS.Hyderabad is an awesome place to live in. I mean atleast for me esp wen you've lived in the city for a decade nearly. Everything's really good here expect for a few things like abiding by the traffic rules n stuff.This is all about Hyderabad city and of course its my Home city. as u all know this is one of the top 5 major cities of india. I hope this review would help anyone who gonna plan to visit hyderabad in future !!! well I want to describe entire hyderabad in all +ve and -ve aspects so that u can decide whether its worth visit or not ??? undoubtedly I say yes !!! who ever visits hyderabad will not be disappoints atleast they may satisfy for their visit.We had been to Hyderabad recently.Its a really nice place.We were there for 4 days and saw d following places:I have been here for the last 3 months , the climate here was awesome compared to other cities , cheap rents , RTC buses were abundent to any where in HYD , spacious roads , new flyovers , luxurious hotels , world class INTERNATIONAL airport (one of the cleanest airports in world) , additional IT Parks @ Gachhibowli , Hitec City , Skyscrapper(100 stores bulding ) is under construction phase by Lanco hills , AP govt @ manikonda (found to be talest in india ) , FACEBOOK ASIA HEAD QUARTER is situated in hyderabad it self......1.RV Nirman - Directors talk well with all respect - till u pay 4L to get into sale agreement. U see real face only after that.Once upon a time in India Bangalore is only IT destination we have & it deserves it.But thanks to globalization we have many more destination there after.So Hyderabad is main destination towards IT& ITES.Thanks for that.Chandrababu naidu is the person who developed that.We always great to him.Cheppandis (pronounce andis not undies) or Curd Rice: These words have been used as synonyms of Hyderabadis. I moved to Hyderabad to get an additional salary of Rs 5000, in hand. I took a Volvo from Pune on 7th Nov 2005, evening 7:25 and by next evening 7:25, I was tired of Hyderabad. From that day till today it’s been 5 yrs 2 months.Sightseeing in Hyderabad is a real treat for all those who wish to be enlightened about the history and culture of ancient India.Hyderabad is now one of the top metros in india, IT HUB, Pharma Hub, medical hub etc, very good in infrastruture, well developments, etc............disgusting, disgusting, all are good but at about internal develoments, nothing all are worst , no proper roads, path holes etc etc etc.I am in Hyderabad since a decade, its best place to live.I came to HYD in 1999 for my studies. Hyd at that time is totally diff & under development.In this 10 years span development graph gone to huge extent.IT industry on peak in this decade thanks to chandrababu naidu.Population also grown very fastly, cost of living is very cheap(compare to Bangalore, Chennai etc.), good transport(metro to be expected), mainly excellent food(worst in Chennai & Bangalore), wide roads(but with lot of potholes), flyovers, more & more.Between Hyderabad and Bhopal in Madhya pradesh the most suitable city to become as future captial city of india is Hyderabad and the points that is so gainfull feel for hyderabad is in hundreds and gainfull points for delhi is negative only.I have been to hyderabad in the month of december during christmas & new year holidays. I have booked a package tour from a online tour booking website name hyderabad tourist.com.“Bujhli Sain, there is a lake like Nalban of Kolkata, in Hyderabad, known as “Durgam Cheruvu”. We can have a visit there”, said the flirtbaaj Ayan. But, no one has any idea, where is it. Even, 50% people of Secundrabad have heard about it, but do not know its exact location. Our PG servant “Kancha” told that it is near Jubilee Hills circle. Prady said in a fed up mood, “Dhaath Teri ki! We will search that place by ourselves”.This is Krishna Mohan. This month end I travelled from Bangalore to Hyderabad on bike. It's my dream and ambition to travel long distances on bike.Srisailem is a small village situated in India's largest tiger reserve near the banks of River Krishna.I’ve just come back from my short holiday trip to Ramoji Film City – Hyderabad, and just thought of sharing my experience. I booked a 2 night package at Hotel Tara at Ramoji Film City, the booking was done through their local sales office at Ahmedabad.   (Rs. 10, 600/- for a couple includes buffet breakfast + lunch + dinner + One time guided tour of the film city) we took the morning direct Indian Airlines flight from Ahmedabad – Hyderabad (Dep: 7:50 am, Arr: 9:30 am) From Hyderabad airport we took a prepaid cab to Secunderabad, I had booked a room at Hotel Raj Comfort Inn, which is at paradise circle.Taramati Baradari is about the legendary romance and the elegance of the Qutub Shah dynasty. Taramati was to Abdullah Qutub Shah, what Bhagmati was to his grandfather Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah, the Founder of Hyderabad. Abdullah Qutub Shah's, the 7th Sultan of Golconda, epic love for his favorite courtesan, Taramati.But for Taramati, the relatively lesser known singer-dancer, did not get the kind of honour what Bhagmati got when Mohammad Quli, who named the city of Hyderabad he founded in the Deccan after his lover.All that Taramati could grange in her memory was an open pavilion, made of lime and mortar with a terraced garden, which had 12 doorways(baradari). It came to be known as the Taramati Baradari.Abdullah used to enjoy Taramati's song even while sitting in Golconda fort. Her melodious voice would be carried on the breeze, reaching the prince's ear far away at the fort, thanks to the perfect acoustics in the structure as well as that of the fort. The baradari with 12 doorways were to allow cross ventilation, which was the most ingenuous arrangement at a time when there were no fans/air-conditioners.We went on a Sunday when we was nibbling our feet, doing nothing and lazing out. We started at 4 o' clock on way to gandipet for a ride, But on way, we saw this Punami Taramati Resturant sign board and wanted to grab a quick bite. The beautiful complex actually caught my attention and we forgot that we were actual on way to gandipet and spend the entire evening and most of the nite at Taramati Baradiri. The complex is spread over a vast land at Ibrahimbagh, near Vasavi engineering college, on the way to Osmansagar and close to Golconda, might not have received much attention for a long time. I think the AP Tourism Development Corporation(APTDC) sensed the potential of the structure to draw tourists and has done a commendable job.It has spacious parking lot. No Problems at all. An open air auditorium, which can seat 1, 600 people, an air-cooled theatre that can fit in 500 persons banquet hallThe'Punnami' Multi Cuisine Restaurant is fully air-conditioned and is tastefully done up to provide facilities for dinner and for events to be performed. But food is just right. Nothing great. Don't expect to get 3 star type of food. But nice cosy place to be left alone to grab a bite.Saqi the bar sets mood to bring out the Omar Khayyam in the most drinking individual, especially the night environment. And I did not get in, I just peeked in.The corporation has been using the Taramati Baradari complex as a venue for the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival, the Premavathi Dance Festival and other festivals with folk dances and arts from other parts of the country. The view from the Baradiri is awesome especially of the Golconda fort and the surrounds as sun goes down. Most of our time was spend atop this baradiri until 8 PM. The structure looked equally beautiful after the lights were switched on, which were dancing and changing colors. It was great to see the structure display different shades. But Be careful during night as there could be problem of Bats flying in and out. I felt like the Quli Qtud Shah King with my wife singing out some old hindi songs and when she ran out of breathe, we played FM radio to get the feel. LOLWe spend a little time in the arts and crafts Shoppe located in the complex. Prices of the handicrafts were as usual. Don't touch them. We did do, just window Shopping LOL. For kids there was At least I wish to stay back for the night at least, but Monday was the next day, so I left the place with a promise to come back and stay at least three days at this quite a getaway in the city. Hey they do have accommodation there. I recently visited Hyderabad.  I am sharing my experience herewith.   Hope this will be useful for those who plan to visit Hyd.  Charminar:Well maintained monument.  It is a sweet surprise for those who had visited it when it was very badly maintained and was very dirty.  Things have changed.  It has become a popular tourist attraction once again.  Thanks to AP govt.  There is four wheeler parking facility just across the monument and in front of Mecca Masjid.  Climbing the "minaret" gives nice view of city.  Laad bazaar market is very nearby.  This is a well known place for artworked bangles.   You need to be good at bargaining.  Plan your trip to spare atleast half an hour in laad bazaar.  Cameras attract ticket.  Mecca Masjid:Walking distance from Charminar.  Nice old monument.  It has a granite bench.  It is being said that sitting on this bench gives you a chance to revisit Hyderabad.  Cameras allowed.  Salarjung Museum:Great!  Lot of already said and written about it.  Must see.  It is so big that few hours are not enough to thru the entire museum.   To watch and enjoy this museum properly, visit it on 2 days, half day on each day.  Camera not allowed.  Snow world:Nice place for those who have not experienced snow or snowfall.  Wear dress such that legs are covered. The warm clothing served by them is not long enough to protect legs.  Especially kids face problem because of this.  Cameras allowed.  Birla Temple: May not be a "must-watch" for those who have visited Birla Temples in other cities.  Cameras not allowed.  Birla Science Center:Section on Dinosor is excellent.  Dinosor skeleton is exhibited here.  Planatorim is like any other planatorim. So is science center.  Can be skipped.  Cameras not allowed.  Shahi Qutb Tombs:Nice historical place.  Excellent architecture and design, very well maintened.  Must see.  If you dont know history,  go for a guide.  Cameras need extra charge.  Golkonda Fort: Another must see in Hyd.  If you do not know history of the dynasty that ruled this fort, do go for a Guide.   Guides ask for 250/- or more, but can be negotiated and setteld for 150/-.  It has sound and light show in the evening.  I could not  manage to watch it.  But heard that it is good.  Cameras need extra charge.  Lumbini Park: It has a laser show.  It is good.  If you have watched laser show in other countries, then it may not be that impressive.  For first timers, this is a must-see.  Shows are in the evening. Check out show timings before planning.  Cameras allowed.  Paradise Hotel: This hotel is well-known for non-veg food, but being a strict veg person, I ordered pure veg food.   And I liked the food so much that I am tempted to mention it here.  Veg Biryani was excellent.  Ramoji Film City:Spread across many many acres.  Nice landscaping inside.  Kids as well as adults enjoy it.  For those who have visited Universal Studio, it may turn out to be a disappointing destination.  But these guys going towards that direction.   May be after a couple of years, things will be different.  If you are travelling with kids, then better stay here for one day.   This way, the trip wont be hectic.  You can spend time in gardens after the shows and rides are over.  I found this as an excellent  place for a nice leisurely stroll. Some member  enquired - i wud like to know if its wise to settle down in hyderabad if I m in bangalore?Answer for this is  Yes/No both........It depends on  few things or parameters you can say.......I just try to answer few...1. Location        2.  Food      3. Life Style    4. Pollution  5. TransportTaking one by one 1. LocationWhere are you planning to stay in hyderbad as every city has good/average/low living places.Places like Banjara hill,jublee hills...  etc are too good . they are full of celebreties,politicians   means alll Hi Fis of society .Due to this reason it is costly to find accomodation here at economical expected rate.But it is cheap compared  Banglore place of such kind.2.  Food     -   Generally rice is preffered meal here so if you belong to north/central ....then little struggle for food you have to face.    But if you are staying near to station or where student folks are there ,then you will have no problem then.Reason for this you can say is ....Student inflow from outside(generally north /central is low compared to Banglore where many big Engineering/Management colleges are there.3.  Lifestlye  :-     Depends from person to person.There are equal quality pubs,like Bottle n chimneys,Club8,99mhz  and many more means night life is also here but keep in mind hyd is more on traditional values side.All what you you wanted in banglore will come at nearly same rate ..mostly less Cost of Accomodation is less compared to Banglore. Mostly no brokers ,agents if you search for room.Nothing is missing here in hyd4. Pollution  :- is less than comparing to Banglore.5. Transport :-  APSRTC  i.e State transport is one of the best in country....you can get buses regularly even at night 12 o clock and half hour more too.    APSRTC Volvo buses are the best among fares  n comfort.Our members can comment more on this if I am missing something more in hydSo its upon you and your perception.For an Andhraite like me, after my home town of Vishakapatnam, Hyderabad is what I call as second home. I spent around 3 years of my life here, both as a student, and while working too. I have many relatives, cousins, friends staying here. This review is based on some of my observations of Hyderabadi life . “Nakko bhai, tension kai ku leta re”. That sums up the life of an average Hyderabadi in a nutshell.                        Hi, I am a citizen of Hyderabad or what we call as a Hyderabadi. Like many other Hyderabadi’s,  I work as a software engineer in one of the numerous companies dotting the Cyber Paradise of Madhepura. Does it really matter in which company I work for? Most of the work we do here is what we call as grunt work, that is in simple terms, writing a wrapper class around a third party wrapper class, which is again a wrapper around another technology. Forget it anyway, I myself am not aware of what I do for a living at times, and I  don’t want to confuse you further about it. When I was a bachelor, I would start off my day with a tea at an Irani  tea stall. Well more than Hi tech City or Charminar, we Hyderabadi’s love to spend our time at these Irani stalls, which are an institution by themselves. These outlets are famed for their piping hot, tasty chaiwhich you get at a rock bottom price. Yes they might not be snazzy like Café Coffee Days or the Barrista’sbut we Hyderabadi’s would never give up on them. Some of these are very large, some are very small,  along with the chai, you also get to taste some wonderful pastries, samosas and pakoras. It’s the best retreat for a rainy day. And the best thing is you can spend hours just chit chatting here, without the owner asking you to leave. We cracked many hard technical problems, chatting over a cup of chai in these Iranicafes.                        Anyway I stopped depending on the city’s notoriously fickle public transport, and use my own vehicle to commute to work. Now whats that , the traffic has been stopped, and there is a big procession going on. Oh its one of those jatras which are as much part of the city. Primarily meant to propitiate village deities , they go by various names like Maisamma, Mahankali, Pedamma, Yellamma, Bathukamma . The temples dedicated to these village deities or Amma’s ( equivalent to Amman deities in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka),are quite a landmark by themselves. Mind you however those jatras or festivals are not meant for the faint hearted. Noisy, robust and boisterous, these jatras also see goats, chicken and even buffalos being slaughtered in hundreds and thousands. Many Hyderabadi’s visit these temples for anything from keeping a vow to asking for a wish. That reminds me, considering the love, an average Hyderabadi has for Uncle Sam, we have a Venkateswara temple in Chilukur ,on the outskirts of Hyderabad, where the deity has a power it seems to grant visas.                         So if you are desperately seeking that H1/B1/L1/F1which would enhance your social status and maybe also your marital prospects, make a beeline to this temple. All you need to do is, do the 108 rounds around the temple and submit your wish. Due to some visa seekers being successful, the deity has been nicknamed as Visa Venkateswara. Well anyway the procession is over and I am now buzzing my way through the posh localities of Banjara and Jubilee Hills, where you find the rich and famous of Hyderabad staying. Movie actors, politicians, industrialists, businessmen, Page 3 socialities, you will find them all here. And if by misfortune your colleague happens to live here, be privy to some gossip about their private lives or perpetual bragging of his list of contacts among these big shots. At work, the talk invariably centers around the latest Holly/Tolly/Bollywood blockbuster or the latest Dan Brown bestseller.                         If you happen to be a movie lover or bibiliophile or even both, then Hyderabad is a paradise for you. An average Hyderabadiis crazy about movies, and this is one place, where you can watch a good movie in a comfortable theater, without having to pay a fortune. If you are a Hollywood fan, there is Sangeet, Skyline, Sterling,if its apna Bollywood, you have  Santosh, Sapna, Maheshwari, Parameshwari, Ramakrishna etc. And for all desi Tollywood fans, go to RTC X Roads,  where you have around 20-30 theaters in a radius of 10 km, and you can find all the latest Tollywood blockbuster of your choice. Not only that Hyderabad, has a thriving film appreciation society, which arranges special screenings of golden oldies and classic movies. And yes after hearing about the latest Dan Brown bestseller, I hot foot it to one of  my favorite spots to get a hold of it. Nah this is not one of those posh book shops nor the upmarket Landmark or Shoppers Stop. This is one of those umpteen pavement book shops which contain every type of book from Sidney Sheldon to Sherlock Holmes, from Alistair Maclean to AynRand. And you buy it without having to empty your pocket.                                When I was a student, for me, the favorite haunt was the book bazaar at Koti’s.  Engineering, Medicine, Management, Law, Scienceevery course has the text books you are looking for. If you are not able to afford the cost, you can borrow the book here for a certain deposit of money, which gets refunded after you return the book. And yes, if you are having some old books, which you want to get rid of, you can sell it to these guys, but be careful, they are very smart negotiators. The city also has the famous City Central Library in Chikadapally, which has a vast variety of books on all topics.  Apart from this you have the British Library at Tank Bund, but most of the books there are too British centric. If you are single, footloose and fancy a drink, you have some good pubs too like No 10 Downing Street, where you can indulge in a few pints of booze. And if you enjoy eating out, well Hyderabad caters to all palates, Deccani, Mughlai, South Indian, North India, Chinese, Continental etc.Contd in Comments.I had visited Hyderabad in 2002 with my family.Hyderabad is the fifth largest city in India with an ancient civilisation and culture. Hyderabad and Secunderbad are twin cities, seperated by Hussain sagar which is a man made lake. Hyderabad occupies a unique position on the map of India. With its confluence of cultures and traditions, the city is often described as a link between the north and the south, and a meeting place of the east and the west. The city is nearly 400 years old and is noted for its natural beauty, mosques and minarets, bazaars and bridges, hills and lakes. The name itself brings up visions of a vibrant city of minarets and modern high - rise buildings. A natural and sophisticated blend of old and new, an old 'Nawabi' culture with a new pro-active approach and hospitality. Once famous for it pearl and beads bazaar, Hyderabad has now carved a niche for itself in the IT field of the world. Know as the city of Nizams, Hyderabad is the capital city of Andhra Pradesh in south of India and is one of the most fast growing cities in India. With its fine blend of old and new structures, Hyderabad prides in being one most major city of India finding its place in several historical chapters of India. The city with multihued facets is studded with numerous medieval monuments, perfectly planned avenues, busy shopping areas, mulitplexes and much more, making it one of the most sought after destinationj in the south India. Hyderabad is a very nice and wonderful city, im living in this city by birth . Here what I like most is its appreance , diffrent diffrent places to roam , almost each and every part of its very amazing . Nothing to dislike here except traffic .       Hyderabad is a such big city where you can find different people of diffrent cultures .  Here locations to visit are excellent like we can have snow world to enjoy in summer , lumbhini park to enjoy in winter , balaji temple to visit through out the year , ramgoji film city to enjoy for a whole week like this we can find many places in hyderabad .     One thing you would agree with me is charminar everyone dream to see it once in life  , other is golconda fort very nice to enjoy in the evernings. When the worship comes into catogory here we can find many temples like balaji temple , sanghi, chilkur like many .   Excellent inword and outward appreance of city beacuse of this only every tourist want to visit hyderabad , so I wish to everybody to see once in life hyderabad BEAUTY.This February, we went  to Hyderabad for the first time in our life. The city is a good one with the people always eager to help you out. May be , the city is still developing, bit it can compete with other metro cities very easily. The main attraction is the Salar Jung Museum, a museum to visit, really. I was amazed to view the collections made by the Mughals and the Nizams. Tight security and the structure of museum is really good. Golden ornaments are the real assets of the world. Nearby is the Charminar, a real building,the stair cases are so steep and rounded, that we imagined how the soldiers managed to use these stairs. Beside Charminar, there is a beautiful mosque, Madina. Really beautiful with lots of pigeons roaming around. Golconda fort of Aurangzeb is also great. The structure, height at which it is placed, securities, everything comes into account, when we say about the success defence stories of that fort during battles or wars. Visiting Hyderabad, not seen Hussain Sagar, missed something. Ideal place for having love with couples,gossiping with friends. In the middle of that sagar, there is a idol of Buddha, which is extraordinarily looks amazing in nights, with lighting. If you get chance, just have a visit to Hyderabad. It's really the City of Charminar.Hi All,I've been in Hyderabad two years and no regrets.For someone who came to town with the intention of working and getting by - this city has been easy to slide into and blend in.Hyderabad, the city of Nizam at one time can now be called the new hub of indian IT industry.Hyderabad is distinctly divided into old and new city.

One of the 12 jyotirlingas of lord shiva is situated here. The temple here is known as mallikarjuna swamy temple. It was built in 12th sanctuary during rule of chalukyas. Apart from temples srisailam has much more to offer. Srisailam dam stretching 512 metres is a scenic beauty.  And to add further, we have srisailam sanctuary and vartarapalli waterfall.Frnz...       havin spent most of my life in hyderabad I can assure the authenticity of this information and hope it ll be useful to you..                  Hyderabad is among the most cosmopolitan cities in india and arguably the best managed among this elite group.The city has managed to evolve into cyberabad without losing on the charm of hyderabad.The city offers a variety of tourist spots ranging from picturesque lakes like the hussainsagar and the osmansagar to forts like the golcondaand palaces like those at falaknama..The new beauties like the ramoji film city and the elite madhapur area housing the nift, BITS(gettin ready) and the cyber corridor only add to the existing beauty of the city made famous by the charminar.                The best part is the very easy transportation available. Comfortable and cheap too.. The whole city is well connected by an intricate network of buses and the multimodal transport system(high speed trains).U have buses every minute!im afraid this is not the same wid trains as buses are usually preffered.                       The city has grown a lot in the recent years and now is a prominent IT hub.Everybody seems to be interested in the city right from Bill Gates to Bill clinton to George Bush recently.. These visits have had a great impact,positive ofcourse,in the form of the manyfold increase in the beautification of yhe city..So much that when I visited delhi I was surprised to see it wasn better than hyderabad(true)!! Frankly I still am not sure what attracts the americans though.. They make it a point to make the city an important part of their visit. We gettin our own international airport , are  bidding for F1 and gettin a US consulate..                                    This marvel of a city can  only be experienced by visiting it.You might even make it your home. All I wish to say is, welcome to hyderabad!Hyderabad Capital city of Andhra Pradesh,gifted place for our Mother India, Having all cultures staying at one place.HYDER= Brave ABAD= the living, the prospering, The Happy. We have 2 Era's in Hyderabad history, pre Chandrababu Naidu, post Babu Naidu in pre Babu we have Golconda Fort, Charminar, Mecca Masjid, Masab Tank, Hussain Sager, Parade Grounds, Abids, Nampally, Secundrabad, Toli Mosque, Begum pet, Osmania University, Salarjung Museum, Birla Mandir, Toli Masjid, Legislative Assembly, etc., There was a man Hussain Shah Wali, people were dying from lack of water and draught and they went to this pious man Hussain Shah Wali to give them solution, he was hardworking, he took with him 400 men and women and started digging a man made pond when the pond was complete he prayed, until recently this pond served the drinking needs of Hyderabad. This is the biggest man made pond anywhere. This is now known as Tank Bund, for there is a Tank on display from the 2nd World War. Now this pond is lined by a beautiful road, called Necklace Road, 18 Km. long, there is I-Max Shopping Complex and theater along it with numerous parks, Boats Club, Ferry Rides, and Afloat Restaurant on a yacht. There is Secretariat nearby the seat of the Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh, where he is present solving problems of his state Andhra Pradesh. Legislative Assembly is near it and there is open air theater, Ravindra Bharati a drama and stage theater, Nampally Railway Junction, a Bogie repair yard biggest in South India. Police Central Control Room, Birla Mandir made of Marble and artistically lit up in the night Abids Circle, this has the biggest shops concentration in one area since now 150 years. We are a city famous of Gem Traders so we have CARAVAN just look at this whole area to know the beauty of planning went in it. The KOHINOOR was cut in this area of the old, this is one cluster of things I describe and if I go on like this. 8000 words limit of mouthshut will not be enough for me. We have Fateh Maidan Stadium, it has got this name for being a camp to the Armies of the 1st.Nizam (Administrator) this is the meaning of word Nizam, we have Lakdi-ka-pool (Wood Bridge) very old, Salarjung museum (Biggest collection of artifacts by a single man) Golconda Fort (450 Years old) Sound and light show conducted here is worth seeing. Osman Sagar a beautiful lake, Zoological Park where we have safari rides, we are inside a bus and Lions are free around us, there is a cute meter gauge train ride for about 45 minutes along the zoo. We have big network of metro trains commuting from east to west and north to south every area is accessible, we have city buses in every nook and corner of the city, we have Auto-Rickshaw 3 wheel, yellow color, black top like cute butterflies spread on all roads of Hyderabad, they charge you with meter no bargains no headaches, get on get down and pay the meter, call taxis available everywhere, call them and give your location and go where your heart desires they charge you by kilometer. We have sight seeing tours of all historical monuments run by Tourism Department, they take you to Badshahi Ashur Khana, 7 Tombs, many other worth visiting places. Renuka Choudhary, India Tourism minister is from Hyderabad. Everything is cheap in Hyderabad; you will love to spend money just to have the pleasure of spending this you wont get anywhere in the world. Everyone is bigger than you in other part of the world, the Shop Owner, the Taxi Driver the Bus Conductor, the Restaurant Waiter, but in Hyderabad culture the SPENDER is the BOSS. Culture ok, we will talk about culture, we have Urdu, Telugu, Hindi, English understood by every child of Hyderabad, every other place people worship their cities, they resent outsiders they don’t want to share their city with anyone, and they have gangs for this purpose. We don’t worship our city, we LOVE it and we want you to come judge and see our love is justified on not????? We have world renowned colleges and universities. I always find people smiling on Airport and Railway stations of Hyderabad, it may be because of the humor of Hyderabad, you hear loud sounds of laughter all around, because we have the longest running comedy stage show in the world (Adrak-ke-Panjay) evolved from our culture, it entered (Guinness book of world records) Ram Gopal Verma is a product of Hyderabad. We all owe these achievements to our delicious Biryani. We have BIRYANI everywhere in the world: Hong Kong, Karachi, Chicago, Toronto, London, New Jersey, Melbourne, Sydney, Auckland, Wellington, Jeddah, Dubai, and Cairo, come taste Hyderabad Biryani and tell us, we want it from your mouth. We have unique cuisine available in all corners a mixture of food from north, south, east, west India blending in our culture to bring a flavor of its own, we have Dhabas, 5 Star Hotels, popular Restaurants spread all over our city. There was a plague in old times; the King Quli Qutub Shah(Ibrahim) built CHARMINAR as a triumph over this plague. All Historical buildings in Hyderabad has combination of architecture Afghan, Hindu, Persian, Arab mixed together to produce buildings nowhere visible in India, Mecca Masjid minarets are based in a huge cauldron cut out from solid rock. This is worth seeing and believing what I am saying above. Italians say come to Naples and die, we say come to Hyderabad and learn to live life, we have around 2500 water bodies in and around, no severe cold and heat, we have moderate temperature ranging from 15 to 40 degrees. Easy transport, cheap shopping, good food, happy people (no resentment) and loads of History and pretty Geography. We have International Airport, No Sea though, well connected by Road Network and Air to all parts of India, we are 600 Km from Mumbai (Bombay) 550 Km from Chennai (Madras) 450 Km from Bangalore. Modern Hyderabad is improving fast, roads widening, townships, arcades, malls, formula one circuit, flyovers, stadiums are being constructed at supersonic speed and still a flat in prime location cost Rs.700,000/= (US$ 15,500) is that CHEAP or what ? Yo!!! India checkout Hyderabad, a city of History and pretty Geography!!!!!Srisailam is a comfortable four hours ride from Hyderabad. It is one of the most important pilgrimages for Shiva’s disciples. Once you are out from Hyderabad touch Uppal and go straight crossing LB Nagar PS. Thankfully the road signs are enough to guide a driver to the destination. Not much dhabas or eateries in this route for refreshments.The place is on top of a hill. Following the dam as it slowing unfolds itself through the curves and bends of the hill road is simply put – breath taking. I was lucky to find one of the log gates open. Stand with the rocks behind your back and the water plunging down from the log gates, you are bound to enjoy the rainbows that created with thousand of water particles floating around.People walk down to the river and have bath. I did not find the place hygienic.I found myself a nice place near the ridge – it is a guest house run by a local association.  (Contact Purushottam – 08524 95824 / 288333)  Most places to stay are run by charitable organizations. The AC suite cost Rs. 500 / day with food extra. Standing in the balcony you see the dam clearly.  Talking of food – not much of an option. Regular vegetarian fare is available at the APTDC hotel or at Canteen no 11. APTDC does not give the food in parcel. The food is reasonably good in Canteen no 11 – opposite the main temple.As with any other temple in India – this temple also has separate lines for paid and not paid darshans. The day I was there, there was a huge line for paid visits and I waited for over an hour to have darshan.As one of the main Shivaite pilgrimage you can well imagine the rush for darshans especially if the day is auspicious. In the afternoon, we trudged down the hillside to take a ropeway down to Patalganga.  APTDC runs this ropeway and there is also a boat ride which you try. Coracles can also be seen around. If you reach early try to take a boat ride to Belum caves which is around one hour one way! I missed since I did not know of the timings.Next day, we were off to see Nagarjunasagar Dam – unfortunately it was raining and we reached around two in the afternoon. No rides after one! Again no good eateries nearby. You can see one half made structure while approaching the dam – that is where Satyam Shivan Sundaram was shot.A small detour takes you to Ethipothala waterfalls. If you have visited Chitrakut waterfalls and seen the splendour of the four cascading falls , you can well imagine the splendour of Ethipothala. APTDC has proper walkways for people to enjoy the falls. They also run a small restaurant. There is a entrance fees of Rs 5 per head. I reached Hyderabad around ten in the night after an enjoyable stay at Srisailam.---------------------------HYDERABAD----------------------------Since there is no category for the town of Warangal, though of writing it here as Warangal is close enough to Hyderabad to be called as excursion. Visit to Warangal could be performed in a single day and if you have your own vehicle, then its far more easier.We were in Hyderabad a couple of weeks ago. Our visit was coming to an end and we were on the weekend anticipating our return early Monday morning. It was the last weekend day and like we were used to the Garden city, we thought we will keep our last bit of shopping to the last day. Unfortunately, Hyderabad sleeps on weekends unlike other cities.At least it “was” tension free. Gone were the days when Hyderabadi’s were very leisurely people in the world. Weather was ( was) so good that by the evening there was always a drizzle. Hyderabad was and has been very famous for its cinema halls, its Irani restaurants, and it's Biryani (food)         At present it has become very dusty and main roads have become very congested with so many vehicles from new found wealth called software that you can not imagine.           There has been no proper planning and the people of  Hyderabad are now paying for it. There are no drizzles in the evening and no empty large Irani restaurants where you can hear ''his master’s voice'' on gramophone records for 10 paisa. The culture of Hyderabad also got a tilt with many Andhra area people coming and buying lands on huge scale. The earlier ones from himachal pradesh who came to Hyderabad  and took up grape farming have now , most of them sold the lands making them neat into housing plots. They became multi millionaires.        Still Hyderabad retains it's old glory and acquired the new one called ''hi-tech city'' where you can see wonderfully architecturally designed office buildings incorporating all most all of the great Indian companies  and some of the foreign companies like Oracle corporation and Microsoft etc.,      Even now you will get wonderful grapes and the same old famous pullareddy sweats.    The locations you have to see: Museum: The Salarjung museum which is one of best in the world is very near to the main bus stand called Imlibun bus station but officially named as :MAHTMA GANDHI BUS STATION'' . It is the biggest bus station in the continent of Asia, such a huge one ( it is nearly hexagonal ) you won't see even in Japan or China.  The Salarjung museum has one famous piece of sculpture called 'REBECCA'  . You must see it to believe.  You can also see some of the most famous paintings of the artists including great Indian artist Raja Rave Varma.        Most of the articles in the museum are several hundred years old and have great antique value. You will see some of the most beautiful Greek art and some ghandhara art in the form of marble statues of almost naked ladies just standing along the verandah !         No air conditioning and proper care to the great paintings will hurt you. Most of them you can see with dust on them. Charminar:Hi friends!!!! Exams are over now and its time to have fun, time to party buddies. Well according to me to have fun is to hang out around with friends or go to some picnic spots with family.I had been waiting for this for a long time, visit hyderabad, and finally this holi I decided to visit this place and see whats in store for me. I first came to Hyderabad 2 years back in April. Not really the best time to come here! But this place has a way of growing on you, and not in a negative way! I really began to love this city within 3-4 months, and that tells a lot, as I just came B'lore where I lived for totally over 6-7 years. I have been working in many cities in India, like Hyderabad, Banglore, Chennai, Gurgaon(Delhi). Of all  these I found Hyderabad the best. In some aspects others are good, but overall hyderabad is the best. You name any kind of entertainment you have it in Hyderabad. Be it films, holiday spots, monuments.....,. The locations I found best are Ramoji filmcity, Charminar, tankbund, necklace road, Hitech City, Silparamam, Dola-ri-dhani etc..,.It has a mixed culture of the country. the only defect between all these is the absence of greenary. You have good hotels Taj (Krishna, Banjara,Residency),Grand Kakathiya....,. The main attraction is the roads, though the traffic is more, as it does in every city. The construction of Flyovers was a good step to develop the city. But there are some places where Flyovers can be built. Next comes Hussainsagar, located in the heart of the twin cities. Though it is full of drainage water, the development that was done around it is of first class. Lumbini park, NTR Gardens, Sanjeevayya park, necklace road and IMax are added attractions to this. The statues, depicting the culture and History of the state, on the side of the TankBund are added attractions. Charminar, though it is located in the worst part of the city, its worth to have a look at this monument. The ornament shops in the surroundings are added attractions to this. Not to forget Salarjung Museum, Golkonda Fort which depict the history of the city. Travelling is also very good from place to place. One can easily catch a Bus to go anywhere in the city quite easily. Busstand, Railway stations, airport are good. Airport, have to see when the new one starts construction. RamojiFilmcity is the place where a director can complete a film without going for any outdoor locations. I think only Sea location is not available there. It has sets from our ancient age to modern age. Infact it also has sets for foriegn location. The theatres are really good compared to other cities. The rates are also very affordable. Who dont know the taste of Hyderabadi Biryani. We can get that almost every where in the city, but prefer only some locations. Next to the modern IT technology. The developments seen in Madhapur/Cyberabad are quite sensational. The buildings are quite good. apart from these are the IIIT,IBS. Software industry in almost next only to Banglore. Apart from these there are many aspects regarding Hyderabad. It has a mixed urban culture. The style of the Language which is a mix of urdu and telangana telugu, which looks qite funny for the perfect telugu speaking people. For me this is the Best city as it has all kinds of Entertainments and activities. I hope tourists will have fun visiting HYDERABAD. bye, Aravind“One of the largest and wealthiest of India's former princely states, Hyderabad built its fortune on the trade of pearls, gold, steel, fabric and, above all, diamonds, which some believe remain hidden beneath the foundations of Golconda Fort, precursor to the city some 10km (6 1/4 miles) away. Once the most famous diamond kingdom in the world, Golconda was home to the Koh-I-Noor, as well as the Orloff, Regent, and Hope dynasties, famous for their bloody histories…”Drive from Hyderabad to Bangalore via NH7.Once a Hyderabadi, Always a hyderabadi....The Future of IT sector:I'm not sure why more has not been written/known about Hyderabad. It also makes me think that's what makes the city special. It is a hidden jewel. So much hype and hoopla about Bangalore.. all for nothing (read my review on Bangalore in mouthshut.com). But Hyderabad is city that does not come with all the hype but still has to offer much more than what Bangalore has to offer. Hyderabad...The Pearl City of India. Hmmn! how many of you know that Hyderabad is known as the pearl city? Its now more or less a decade over 400 years that this city has been formed. It is also known as Bhagyanagar. The best thing about Hyderabad is that it has something to offer for everyone, irrespective of their interests, class, taste and budget. Hyderabad is one of the most happening cities in India and perhaps the most interesting city you would ever visit. Hyderabad today stands tall among the modernized cities, still it retains the old, unique charm which you cannot find anywhere else.Bhongir Fort is perched on a massive piece of granite in the town Bhongir(i), 50 kms away from Hyderabad.  I did not expect it to be any different than the hundreds of forts that lie all over the Deccan.  But it is different.  Firstly, it’s not a tourist attraction; there are no Archaeological Survey of India signs, no booths, and no vendors.  All you will find is a rough path winding up from Bhongiri town, after about 50m, stone steps magically appear running the whole length of the ramparts.  After you make it past the main arched gateway, and through a grove of wild custard apple and guava trees, you will find yourself on open rock.  On your left is a huge gash in the rock, which had been dammed creating a series of reservoirs.  The first of these cisterns is a muddy pond replete with frogs and surprisingly delicate white water lilies.  The other cisterns have all been eaten up by that accursed water hyacinth.  Making your way up the path, you will meet a steeper incline, and the steps are now cut directly into the rock.  The path to the summit swerves around the edge of the rock.  Although a rusty bannister has been furnished, those with vertigo should be weary.  At the summit is an old cannon that points out in the general direction of Hyderabad.  In addition, there's a two-storied construction, although it too is in ruins, its safe enough to climb via a spiral staircase.  The view from the top is outstanding.  I went in the month of December, when a disturbance in the Bay of Bengal had brought rains to the area.  The light mist and even lighter drizzle made the climb refreshing rather than tiring.           Describe your trip.I must confess...I have been a Delhite all my life and when I got trandferred to Hyderabad I was a bit sceptical...But two years which I spent in Hyderabad made me forget all the years I spent in Delhi...The place is amazing...people superb...food as good as it can get...and lots of places to visit...When I retire this would be one place I would want to be...Let me take you on a guided tour in terms of what you can doHi there, I , Surya Mangipudi, resided since 30 years in this enchanting city called by different names like Hyderabad(with a twin brother Secunderabad),Bhagyanagar and now of course under our dynamic CM Mr. Naidu being called as Cyberbad. I have seen the other 4 four Metros and Bangalore too though on short trips but I felt my city stands apart well away from the other 5. This is the place where you can spend good time with ur families,relatives and friends. Let me be clear in one thing , my Hyderabad is not a place for Honeymoon visits and except this, this is the place for every thing. I went around my city , nook and corner, on my RX100 and take my word, this is a city where you get to see all cross-sections of people. My city is today number 1 in Software Development and in the good books of Microsoft and its CEO Bill Gates. We Have got Microsoft India at our place which makes us feel proud. The Previous US President Mr. Bill Clinton and Microsoft Supremo Bill Gates took time from their tight schedules to visit Hyderabad. This city gave many talented sportsmen to our country who brought laurels , name and fame. If Bangalore is though ahead of us today in Software Development , we are slowly inching towards it at a great pace and pretty soon will become the San Fransisco of India.It has been almost three years since we came to Hyderabad from Delhi.It was a little difficult relocating but it was clearly destination Hyderabad, which has changed tremendously in these 3 years.This city has its own charm and has been able to maintain the balance between the old and the new; it is cosmopolitan yet traditional. It is unlike other cities which are bursting on seams with population, pollution, commuting, politics and other problems.Commuting does'nt take much time, people are generally warm and friendly, you can very well survive without knowing telugu! (advantage unlike Chennai), you can pick up Deccani Hindi which is so much fun to hear and speak as well, auto guys don't take you for a trip(unlike delhi!)going to movies is good fun- it is definitely the cheapest among all the metros,you can enjoy typical hyderabadi cuisine at reasonable rates, eating out is still cheaper than any other metro,pubbing has picked up here and lots of new lifestyle stores and places to shop at!! Only city where you taste the best stuff including haleem during Ramzaan.Within the city there is Charminar and Laad Bazaar to be visited(a must see!), then there is Birla Mandir, Mecca Masjid and should not miss the Salarjung Museum- a place worth dekko!Though not much choice for weekend getaways yet one can go to places like Nagarjun saagar,Srisaisalam Raymond's tomb etc. Otherwise if you have the time Hyderabad is pretty well connected with all the major cities like Mumbai,Bangalore,Chennai- it is only overnight journey to these places.A nice city which can be visited anytime between October to March, only painful months are April, May and June, otherwise climate is fine.Hats off to Chandrababu Naidu for improving the city and making it a showpiece for Andhra Pradesh!!!!I have been a proud resident of Hyderabad for the last 17 yrs of my life. It is the place to be for its cosmopolitan outlook. Hyderabad is very well known for attractions like historic Charminar, splendid Salarjung museum etc. and of course the grandeur of the Nizams can be seen everywhere especially in the old city of hyderabad. Offlate there have been umpteen good tourist additions to the city like the Ramoji Film City, Shiparamam Arts village and NTR gardens.The One thing you notice after coming to Hyderabad is that the city is very much clean. After getting down from the Train on the nampally station(that is what they call it) you feel pleasant. The city offers very good breakfast/ lunch and dinner and is heaven for them who like Biryanis and Paya.There are very famous hotels in the near by area of Charminar which offer excellent Biryani. Abids is the happening area in the city which one will find similar to mumbai. The twin cities of Hyderabad and  Secunderabad constitute the capital of Andhra Pradesh. Hyderabad is famous as the former seat of the fabulously wealthy Nizams of  Hyderabad. It is an important centre of Islamic culture, and is central India's counterpart to the Mughal splendour of the northern cities of Delhi, Agra and Fatehpur Sikri.For those of you who have seen film stars prancing around similar trees in recent times, well, that is because all those songs have been shot at Ramoji Rao Filmcity in Hyderabad. In all my twenty one years of living in Andhra Pradesh, I had been to Hyderabad exactly thrice. First time to attend my EAMCET counselling. Second time to visit a cousin of mine. Third time, to work for a company out there.Chronicling 400 years of Hyderabad's history is not easy. Especially history as rich and diverse as that of The Charminar. Just around four centuries ago, a devastating epidemic of plague gradually abated in the fabulous kingdom of Golconda, South India. The King, Qutub Shah in thanksgiving decided to build a square pavilion with tall towers at the four corners.I am neither from south India nor a student of History.Hyderabad has a prominent place among all historical places of the world.It is due to Salar Jung Museum.There is statue of Lord Buddha in Hussen Sagar.You will enjoy this in evening from Birla Mandir.There is historic Charminar.You will enjoy lights and sounds at Golkunda Fort.Sitting on chair in the ground  which will take you ancient time.But I never forget Salar Jung museum.It is not away from Kachiguda Railway station.Osmania Hospital,Juma Masjid,Charminar all are within 1.5 kilometer.In museum collection of Indian and Europian Art are main.One full day is not enough.There is a clock in the museum what only you can see at Hyderabad.Paintings of Nandalal Bose,Jamini Roy,Ravi Varma.Especially Sculpture ''Belrebbeca'' I will remember last day of my life.Located in the south central part of India, Hyderabad has a distinct identity of its own, amalgamating the cultures of north and south.  A cosmopolitan city, Hyderabad is a center of attraction for its blend of Moghul grandeur and modernity.The city endowed with variety of cultures, presents attractive amalgam of old world charge together with the ebullience of growth and enterprise.  This 400-year-old bustling city with beautiful edifies built in the medieval, moghul and colonial styles definitely deserves more than a look around.Successive dynasties from the Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagaram kings, Qutb Shahis, Mughals and the Asaf Jahis, have contributed significantly to the city’s rich cultural tapestry and have left behind a heritage studded with spectacular monuments, temples, mosques, palaces all vibrant with arts, crafts dance and literature.Hyderabad, is probably the most happening place in South India. People here are quite nice to strangers, hotels are decent, quite a few places to go out, and top of all these IT enigma, which has still to go down. All these are good things, but one bad thing is the horrible traffic and even more pathetic traffic sense of the Hyderabadi's. It has got some good places to see, but I strongly request any new comers not to go to Necklace Road on a hot evening. Its very bad.The city is good for spending time in Shopping malls in Banjara Hills and Begumpet.Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh has a long and illustrious history of 400 years. It served as the headquarters of the Qutub Shahis and their successors, the Asaf Jahis. Situated on the banks of the river Musi, this city has many splendors and wonders of rich variety, which keeps the visitors spell bound. Welcome to the city of hyderabad, once known for its nawabi life style is fast adjusting to the computer life style, thanks to the dynamic chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.Kadapa: In this route tirumala hills main door for kadapa,from here to tirumala we can go 7 hills with in a one day here baba saheb samadhe is present in this kadapa and we can pray to this god will cure the problems Hindi star amithab bacchan he will pray to the god here near kadapa kandimallaiya village is present sri virat veerabhramendre swampy is Hindu vishwakarma god is jeeva samadhi and this god vishwa bhramin he is doing work in ancient time is gold smith and Akbar badusha in ancient in exams he want to said to this god to eat non veg and OK I will eat the non veg said that god then eaten gone to eaten that non veg becomes fruits and more miracles are there in kandimallaiya and curing disease and for marriage problems and I have watchmen in my eyes it is true.We were on summer vacation and visited kadapa district.

Tourists require a inner line permit to visit this capital city. Comfortable volvo buses ply between Gauwahati and Itanagar. The best way to come to Itanagar is to fly from Delhi to Lilabari that is 69 km from Itanagar. Itanagar has got something for everybody. The museum is located near the gompa, showcases the culture of Arunachal Pradesh with the help of life-size models depicting life scenes of the various ethnic groups of the state. One can have an overview of the cultural heritage of the entire area without visiting every nook and corner of this large state.

The monastery belongs to the Gelugpa school and has a religious association with Drepung Monastery in Lhasa, which continued during the period of British rule. It is very close to the Tibetan border, located in the valley of the Tawang-chu which flows down from Tibet. The monastery is 3 stories high and occupies an area of 140 m². It is enclosed by a 610 m long compound wall. Within the complex there are 65 residential buildings and 10 other structures.On my recent vacation I went to the Tawang with my family which included my parents and we 5 siblings. The journey from Guwahati to Tawang is what was most adorable. The only negative about the entire travel was the road condition once you are in the hills. I have been to many many hill stations in India but take my word for the fact that these were the most dreadful and dangerous roads ever. Anyways it is worth it to visit tawang and acquaint oneself with the history of India China relationship and its effect on the civilians.The unforgettable trip to Tawang on the Indo China border (Lhasa in Tibet and Beijing are 450 Km and 4500 Km respectively from here) in Arunachal Pradesh via Tezpur (A cosmopolitan city in Assam with an Indian Air Force base), Bomdila, Dirang (and its hot springs) and Sela (The highest place I have ever been to,14000 ft above mean sea level. The first time I got to experience snowfall, was here in Tawang) started on 19th of January.Writing something on Tawang is something on paintings of Monolisa..you have many things to write .. but you have dont have exact words to describe it .. Anyway I will try my best to give more n more info about tawang... Mooreed high up in the mountain ranges of the Himalayas, at 3500 meters above sea level is Tawang-the beautiful land of Monpas. With sobriquets like :The Hidden Paradise or Land of Dawn-lit mountains; this land evokes images of awesome mountain views, remote hamlets, quaint and sleepy villages, magical Gonpas, tranquil lakes and allot more. At Tawang, you have a heavenly tryst with nature at its best and the heady mixture of history, religion and legends. Guwahati: Guwahati is gate-way of north east of india.It lays in the bank of Brahmaputra one of India's longest river after Ganga and in Plateau of Shilong.Guwahati is an exotic place in the northeast and a town of temples .I personally visited twice and will must visit many more.The most famous of the city is Kamakhya temple on nilachal rock in the city .We reached very early morning and it was a Tuesday and very crowded .Through many stairs we reached the altar of God and offered puja with the help of a panda( priest ).We stood on a general queue paying Rs.101.The altar is covered with a red cloth .We visited bhubaneswari temple and from there saw the entire city of Guwahati in birds view.Then we journeyed to peacock island by launch and on that island visited umananda mahadev temple who is bhairav of maa kamakhya .Its a sateepith .In the evening we by bus went to vishisth ashram and vishidhganga.The atmosphere is serene .Then we visited Navgraha temple ,shukreshwar temple ,Balaji thirupati temple ,dilapidated paandu temple on the bank of river Brahmaputra .We went to the state museum ,fancy market ( the most crowded market in guwahati), guwahati zoo( very famous for deer).

It is about 25 km from the city center, can reach city by Taxi, they are easily available.We had been to Guwahati-Hajoa-Siaulkuchi-Nameri-Kaziranga-Shillong-Guwahati trip very recently. This review is purely about Guwahati and nearby places.With the unfringing essence of life & a blend of culture, greenery, serenity, composure, beauty & hospitality, Guwahati would always be attracting people from across india and beyond towards it!Being from Assam(guwahati actually :)), I would like to pose a thing or two about Guwahati! The capital (almost as Dispur, the capital is a part of Guwahati itself), is a peaceful(unlike most of us would conceive) and beautiful city!Despite, the rumours of terrorists roaming around in the city, which I assure is not the truth, most of the ulfa/terrorist activities take place in the borders of the states and not in Guwahati or any other city-towns, Guwahati is pretty safe & approachable! Apart from some other terror activities which I think takes place almost everywhere these days, there is peace! So, probably u dont have to worry too much!With lots of attractive places to visit, like the kamakhya temple, Pobitara sanctuary, Umananda temple, river brahmaputra, Nabagraha temple and a lot of others, Guwahati is a soothing experience for the tourists!Previously called Pragjyotishpur, the city can be traced untill as early as 6th century,and the cultural history of guwahati is very vast and intense, and so are its roots of growth and well-being! Assam is full of cultural heritage borrowed from the great ahom rulers, which defines the state's name - Assam!Guwahatihas a rich educational history too, Cotton College( the oldest college in entire northeast, and may be older than some in other parts), was opened in the year 1901!Tourist attractions -Temples -a) Umananda temple or Umananda Devaloi (Dev = devta aloi = alay in sanskrit, meaning home) - This is a temple located in the middle of brahmaputra river, and it can only be accessed by boats & ferries, which are very frequent! Situated near kachari ghat, this one is a sheer wonder, and is a must visit for travellers to guwahati!b) Kamakhya Temple -The most famous temple of Maa kamakhya in the northeast, this is situated west of the city on nilachal hills. Best time to visit - September- October, during durga puja festival.c) Nabagraha temple - Named such, because this Shiva temple has nine symbolic emblems of Shiva covered with different clothes, for the nine planetary gods!Other temples that are worth a visit are, Basistha temple, Sukreshwar temple, Dol Gobinda, there is a beautiful iskon temple too!Recreation -Sankardeva Kalakshetra -It is a nice place where frequent plays and other cultural activities are held, for your artistic choices and pleasure. It displays a historical showcase of assam, and other north-eastern states, a cultural excavation worth a visit!Pobitora Sanctuary- 52 Kms from Guwahati, is a sanctuary known for its one-horned rhinoceros and a lot of other animals, is the home for about 2000 migratory birds.Jeep/Elephant safari's are readily avilable for a run in the wild!Brahmaputra river- Boating, local sightseeing and other activities are available here, just near kachari(literally court, a very busy area in guwahati).Fact - Brahmaputra is the only Male river in india!Shopping - Areas like Fancy Bazaar, Paltan Bazaar, Ganeshguri, are busy business areas, which should satisfy all your "shoppoholic"needs :))...Guwahati Zoo, Zoological gardens and Planatarium are other places of interest for enjoyment!On Assam as a whole, places like Sibsagar, jorhat etc has a lot of things to offer too, most famous of them are -Rang Ghar (sibsagar)- A mini colloseum, where the Ahom ( the first kings to invade and rule Assam) rulers, used to enjoy song, dance & plays.Talatal Ghar & Kareng Ghar (sibsagar)- This was a seven storeyed palace, which had secret tunnels for the king to escape during invasions! Now, only half of the palace is open to sightseeing as there were cases of missing people because of the vastness of the palace!Places like Kaziranga National park (200 km from ghy) & Manas national park( 176 kms from ghy, famous for the tigers), are a nice gateway into nature, through elephant rides and mini-safari's! Majuli, a place in lower Assam, is the largest River island in the world!A few points which should be on your minds, and I think could be answered -a) Is it safe?- As safe as it is in mumbai or bangalore or ahmedabad, because all these places have been bombed(sadly)! Probably, safety nowadays is a delicate issue which should be left at bay, so it does not arouse too many doubts and unruly discussions!b) How about Transport ?- City buses, a little crowded, but decent service and cheap(about half of what I pay here in bangalore :))! Rickshaw's are available for petty transportations at a slightly higher cost! Trackers( Jeeps) are available for some of the destination travels too!c) Language barriers?- Not much, hindi / English is used in abundance and people are very friendly, so you should be able to find friends easily :>)d) Expenditure?-Affordable North indian food is available at most places, good hotels are available, my advice stay near the Fancy bazaar, pan bazaar area and you will find decent hotel accomodation and fooding too!I can go on counting places, but I think I have mentioned the most worthy places to visit and enjoy in Guwahati and a few in Assam too, which should help a few of you out there, probably to find the next holiday destination in Guwahati!PS - "Information some of it, borrowed from Wikipedia, and a book I have on Assam's history! No copyright's violation intended!"Hope, you liked the review! Comments and views always welcome!Have a nice day!Whom do you think thebest newcomer (singer) in Bollywood? I say it's none other thanZubeen Garg from a less known place called Assam. Even though he hasgot late success in the cutthroat Bollywood music industry, he hasgot one of the best vocals in the country. Believe me, he is a bigstar in Assam. People just go crazy whenever he sings. Guwahati is among one of the most beautiful cities in India. The city is as warm as its people. Butonly because of some misconceptions like it's only jungle, people are not educated there etc. this city hasn't got the much needed publicity which big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore etc. alwaysenjoy. In fact, Guwahati has some of the country's renowned educational institutions-cotton college, IIT, REC are among some of them. I have withdrawn my article because I no longer feel happy about its quality. I’m sorry if it makes anyone angry or violent. To those who liked my article I have just one thing to say: you wouldn’t like it if you read it today. Trust me on that!

The headquarters is located inside the Munger Fort and undertakes different yoga projects and research in association with several agencies.Nalanda: I went to bodh gaya two months ago and that is when I went to nalanda . I heard and read a lot about the university , its history and the nostalgia that you feel from the very moment you enter the place . A three thousand years old epicentre of education of the world which shows the rich culture of india and its marvelous history.I was very excited . On the entrance is the ticket counter and 10's of guides just waiting for you to pay for the ticket and come in . The moment we entered these guides came to us . We knew there was no way we could understand nalanda without a guide, so we got one and that is how a our journey in nalanda started. From the very beginning he started explaining us what this great institution used to be. Well I missed most of the things as I was busy enjoying the feel of nalanda, the very thought that I am walking in the same pavements were once my ancestors walked , seeing the same rooms where they lived , gives you goosebumps. We saw the classrooms and lecture rooms where students were taught, their rooms were they lived but the most exciting part was the library . This was the place where the archaeologists found hiuen tsang's diary and got all the infirmation about nalanda . It was three storey's high , the guide explained us how consecutive kings contributed to construction of eash storey and I nalanda was destroyed .It is said that when nalanda the set on fire , it burnt for 7 days and people good see nalanda glowing because of fire. It was the pages of the books in this library which were made of copper and helped the fire spread all over the institution . Till now only 10% of nalanda is found , most if it is still under the ground. I never wanted to leave but we had to , and when the sun went down we said goodbye to nalanda. My experience with nalanda was very exciting abd fascinating , I recommend everybody to visit this historical site for once atleast .We visited Nalanda ruins on our trip to patna, since we were staying in magadha inn which was close to this place so decided to visit .As soon as you reach there you will be greeted by a slew of guides we picked some one in random he took 300 rs which was fine and showed us the entire ruins which was once a university and prosperous village.We visited Nalanda as a part of our Gaya trip. This place, ruins of ancient university stands as a proof for the creativity & the building capacity of earlier generations. One would have heard, learnt about Nalanda university during their education, but its vasteness actually strikes your mind once you stand in front of the ruins shown for us now, which is only a part of the complete Nalanda University.I visited Nalanda with my colleague during my visit to Bihar.

However, it is famous for rich biodiversity. It is in an altitude of 560 meters. A verticalfissure in the wall of a hill provides the main enterance to theirregular panaromic chambers of this cave. Colourful dripstoneformation (Stalactite/Stalagmite) inside this cave imparts a look ofheaven. After twisted vertical enterance of 15 meters estimated innerway is of half of the kilometer. Lush green mountains, deep valleys, dense forests, streams, waterfalls, caves, natural parks, magnificent monuments, magical herbs, exuberant festivity and blissful solitude. The very name Bastar in Chhattisgarh conjures up images of the royal past and the mysterious tribes.If you have to forget all the tensions related to work, personal life or any other thing and want to spend some time with yourself, Bastar is the place. Connectivity may not be good, you might not get good hotels around, food can be a problem but what you get there is invaluable. Just spend time there and you will feel fresh and rejuvenated. Cool winds, amazing waterfall, jungles and tribes force you to forget about anything else in the world and get engrossed into an entirely different world.Carrying sufficient water and food is essential. Perfact place to go with friends but in a short group. Needless to say, camera is a must. Hotels are cheap and food is not bad. You can buy so many priceless articles for almost no cost. No need to be apprehensive about people. Good to have some one with you who knows the place. Take some three days and explore as much as you can. There is no single specific place to see at bastar, its upon you... the more you explore; the more you unwind and the more you enjoy. Going with family and kids will not be advisable. A small group of 3-4 friends and private vehicle will be the best way to go for it.New Delhi: Basically I m from mumbai.

In this city from baby to old age is not secure. Although this city has some wonderful monuments like lal kilaa, kutubaminaar, mahroli istanbh, akshardhaam parliyament house, and many more which clean it picture but real is real. In this city lots hotel restrautrant for stay. For transport it has railway buses and airport. Overall this city is not good and not bad. I like this city.New Delhi is the capital of India. The most VVIP persons live there all the embassy situated in this city. The President, The Prime Minister all miniters etc. live in this city. This city has several ancient history.Several  Emperor kept there capital in Delhi.Delhi is said most unsafe city for women s there are kept closed at home. Gals have no freedom to roam nor talk There should be sumthing done by the goverment to safegaurd women s police people should be kept at places to protect women s .New Delhi though is famous now in negative terms but this place is areal gem. This is in terms of number of historical monuments and temples.I have been to New Delhi several times. Its a good city .One of the most amazing cities in the world, New Delhi is also the capital of the country. I must confess I’ve had a love hate relationship with this place.At airport I had a chance to talk to a sales-girl sitting at counter of a shop.It has been 20 years, I am living in New Delhi. I love this place so much. It has everything I need.I love visiting places with my friends and living here in Delhi is a great advantage for me. There are plenty of historical monuments which are incredibly beautiful.I have stayed at Delhi more than two year as I was working for a company which was situated at Delhi, I am having a lot many good experience as well as bad experience over there. As we all know Delhi is capital of India, obviously you will find lot of developed things which you might not find in your locality as well as you will get opportunity to find lots of old monuments made by Moguls.New Delhi is the capital of India and most famous for tourist attraction. Delhi consists of 3 World Heritage Sites, 174 National Protected Monuments and over hundreds of state protected monuments and several unprotected and lesser known monuments.Monuments-Of-Delhi is not just about few dozen old buildings, it is about several ancient mosques, baolis, havelis, walls, gateways, forts, gardens and roads,New Delhi is the capital of India. and a perfect tourist destination too. I had visited New Delhi as one of my friend is studies there.After my graduation, I as here for more than 2 years in Delhi, I used to stay in outskirts of Delhi(Badarpur border), which is bit far from main city, there are so many places to visit here in Delhi, qutub minar, India gate, old Delhi, raj ghat & many places nearby Delhi,New Delhi is an extraordinary city. It is famous for one of the 7 wonders in the world that is 'Tajmahal'. It is a executive seat for the government of INDIA. It is really a good tourist spot.it has a great name for its economical status. It has a good educational and political background too.I am an Indian and I visited most of the cities in India. So I can judge this city with other Indian cities.The Capital of India, this place makes me love for this city a lot. The season changes with time here and the beautiful historical places to visit. This city having a wonderful metro facilities makes this city more beautiful. The people around here are mixed with different states and lived a simple, luxurious life. The people earning in thousands and people earning in crores can live a happy life.I was in Delhi from 10th to 13th of April. Word of advice- do not go in summer as the temp can soar to 40-42 c.The metro rail is amazing and you cannot go wrong if you follow the metro map which is available at customer care centre on every metro station.Most of the tourist places are in the vicinity or else you can opt for hoho bus. Insist on autos with meter. The rate is 20 for first km and then 8. For traversing in the small lanes, try cycle rickshaws and battery operated rickshaws.For foodies, visit to Chandni Chowk to taste parathas and jalebis is a must, for non vegetarians- chawla cream chicken is very good.Shopping- If you are from Mumbai or any other megapolis, nothing spectacular! You have to haggle and bargain a lot with the shopkeepers with them try to cheat you at every step.Hotels- Choose the ones which are near to metro station as travel time to tourist places reduces.Delhi as a whole has two main parts as far as I have experienced and one is Old Delhi and the other isNew Delhi. What makes the difference.It has been a long time I wrote review & thought what’s better than my own city DELHI to write about. One life time is not enough to explore this city (literally).And one review is not enough to describe it. Anyone living in Delhi for even 50-60 years hasn’t seen the whole city yet. There are places you would visit or pass by only once in your lifetime in the city. In this review I will try to give you maximum info. Delhi is a huge city which is the World's most Historical Capital & in terms of green cover its only second next to Nairobi(capital of Kenya). Delhi is trying to apply for UN heritage city status (well deserved). Delhi is a delight for History lovers, art lovers, food lovers, night life party animals (girls should be accompanied with boys), religiously inclined, shopaholics etc. Adventure & wildlife tourism options do not exist in Delhi.Places to Visit-A 1000 places at least! Trust me. But no one can see all. There is a lot to see & do here. So plan in advance & make an itinerary depending upon your number of days.Delhi is (proud) home to three UN world heritage siteswhich are must for all - Red fort, Qutub Minar& Humayun's Tomb. Don’t miss the Sound & light show in Red fort. Reach the fort after lunch, explore the place & then see the show.Other MUST SEE placesIndia Gate-Visit India Gate after Sunset. Spend some time in leisure, sit, walk, have Ice cream (in winters too!), Gol gappas, buy sundry stuff & relax! You would love it.Lotus Temple-The architecture resembles Sydney's Opera House. Its beauty is unmatched in India & is one of the most visited places by tourists (As per Wikipedia it’s been most visited in the World, ahead of Eiffel tower). ISKON templeis just adjacent. Do visit ISKON for its architecture, beautiful gardens & Deity. Akshardham Temple-Beautiful architecture & amazing lawns. At least half a day is required if you want to see it all. Else you can visit only the deity/idol. Walk around Chandni Chowk(CC) & Jama Masjid-Popularly known as the Walled city, this part of Old Delhi is full of energy & excitement. You would come across Mughal style architecture buildings which are very old. The kind of aura here is not found anywhere else in Delhi. Visit Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India. In between shop for various articles from the shops you come across. CC is Asia's largest wholesale market. Travel by Metro or Bus ONLY.CC is famous for the culinary delights it offers. For Non veg/Mughlai dining visit the World famous Karim near Jama Masjid. Moti Mahal in Darya Ganj started a dish called Butter Chicken for the first time in India. It’s a fine dine. Dahi Bhalla @ Natraj Bhalla wala. Hot Jalebis @ Dariba Mkt.Sohan Halwa @ Ghantewala.Japani Samosa @ Bhagirath Place.Parantha@paranthewali Gali(I dont like it!)Connaught Place (CP)-Take a walk around outer & inner circle of CP. CP is famous for its Colonial charm. It’s a great shopping zone as well. You will find top brands & everything else here. The market architecture is simply amazing & no words can describe what CP is. Visit state handloom Showrooms at Baba Kharak Singh Marg for local handicrafts (high prices). One must also visit Palika Bazar, the underground air conditioned market & Janpath. Both are famous for economical products. Palika is famous for all illegal things like pirated/porn CDs, fake chinese mobiles, adult toys, smuggled items etc so you are very likely to be cheated. Janpath is famous for Handicrafts. In Palika & Janpath, bargain hard. Don’t pay more than 25-30% of what they quote you. CP too is famous for the culinary delights it offers.Flavoured milk @ Keventers. Pastries @ WrengersKachori outside hanuman mandir, opp Coffe house. South Indian Fine dine Sarvanan Bhavan at Shivaji Statium, outer circle & Janpath. Chinese fine dine Bercos Inner circle.Nirulas, Outer circle. You will get amazing Pizzas, Ice creams & sundaes. Rajdhani Express for Unlimited food Thali in Outer Circle.Kake da Dhaba for Non Veg lovers in outer circle. Dilli Haat-It’s a village fair run by Delhi Tourism. There are two Dilli Haat. One at INA mkt, South Delhi & another one at Pitampura, North Delhi. It’s best to go to INA one as that’s the popular one. There are reasonably priced handicrafts & delicacies from all states of India. Shop & fill your tummy with some great stuff here. Esp - Hyderabadi Biriyani & Kashmir Kawah. Mughal Gardens-Mughal gardens are situated right inside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the largest residence in the World of any Head of the State in any country. It’s open for only 4 weeks in a year from mid feb-mid march (spring season). Its beauty is unmatched & beyond description. Even if you have seen many beautiful gardens, I am sure this is no 1. You will agree. Old Fort & Delhi Zoo-These two places are just adjacent to each other. Visit old fort & enjoy boating here after you explore the place. Delhi Zoo is a heaven for the bird lovers. Lot of migratory Birds is found here. It’s a well maintained zoo with good number of species & free birds. It’s a great respite from mad traffic & chaos of life.Delhi Metro–This is a must do on almost all tourists mind. Travel on this World class public transport system & feel very proud of India. SOME OTHER PLACESwhich are good. You can visit depending on the number of days you have come here for. Raj GhatSafdarjung TombBirla Temple - Go there for architecture, beautifully landscaped gardens & deity. Bangla Sahib Gurudwara-A very huge & popular Gurudwara, go there to seek blessings & the sheer beauty & tranquility of Gurudwara. One must have Kadha Prasad & Langar here. Kingdom of Dreams-This one is in Gurgaon. Its a bollywood theme park with shows, plays & food court. The food court has cuisines from almost all states of India. Its a unique & extravagant place. Ticket cost weekdays - Rs 750/Weekends Rs 1000. Travel by Metro or Taxi ONLY. On the way see Gurgaon corporate buildings & residential high rises, which are quite a sight. Visit after Sunset ONLY. Jantar Mantar-An example of Historic monument being wasted. It’s a famous place for demonstrations/protests visited by Anna, Baba Ramdev etc frequently & there are demonstrations 365 days a year. There is nothing to see as the place is used as dumping ground by the protestors who even use it to answer nature's call. Must have south Indian food from a stall opposite Jantar Mantar. Garden of five senses-A beautifully landscaped garden meant to invoke your five senses- sight, sound, touch, smell & taste. Do check it out.Chatarpur Mandir-Visit there for architecture & seek blessings. Nizamuddin Dargah-Located close to Humayun Tomb, is very famous among poeple. While you are moving around in the city you will pass through Lutyens Delhi. Thats the VIP area of Delhi where you might spot your area MP residence too. Have you heard 10, Janpath or 7, Race course road? At certain places you would feel you are not in Delhi, but Europe. It’s a super well maintained areaa. Pragati Maidan, the largest fair site in India hosts some interesting fairs you may wish to visit:- Auto Expo every two years in Jan. -Book Fair every year in Aug-Sep-India International Trade Fair from Nov 14- Nov 27. It’s visited by millions per day. Tughlakabad Fort is not worth mentioning and seeing. It’s just deserted ruins in the jungle.Contd in comments.One of the sad parts about visiting a city is that when you're in the city, you realise that many locals havent seen the city though they have lived a lifetime there. In mumbai, for example, I had been to Haji Ali only after 7 years of being in Mumbai. Similarly, in Delhi, not many have visited  Jantar mantar which is at its heart. Therefore an outsider might appreciate the place much better.So here's a quick "What you should do, where/how/why you should go etc" et al when you plan to visit Delhi. The first question is - Is Delhi worth visiting? Absolutely!What's great about Delhi?1. History - A city that has a long and rich history and as a result lots of places of historical significance/hertiage are in Delhi.And this is the biggest reason one should visit DelhiPlace you must see and that are easily accessiblea. Red Fort- Near chandi chowkb. Rajghat- Gandhi's memorialc. Qutub Minar - The entire Qutub complex is an experience, be it the mosque which was built using the ruins of a temple and the artisans of the hindu community. Beautiful blend of both cultures. d. Humayun's tomb - This monument can come close to the taj - Fascinating monument where you can spend hours!!! This tomb also has other tomb's attached it to and the entire complex is worth an experience.e. Purana Quilla - Couldnt spend much time here but whatever little I could see, it was worthf.  India gate and rashtripati bhavan - The entire central secretariat area has several   buildings/monuments such as India Gate, North and South Block are places one can visit. Also try and visit India gate at night when it's lit up.g. Lajpat Nagar/chandni chowk/Saket - For some shopping. Couldn't try any barathtvla's though :(h. Jama masjid - The largest mosque in India. Entry fee is part of many monuments except Jama Masjid. Fee would range between Rs 5 to Rs 30. An audio guided tour could cost Rs 100.2. Roads and Delhi Metro : For anyone coming from Mumbai or Bangalore - This is surely to hit them. MASSIVE roads everywhere and must say good roads. As for the Metro, again coming from Mumbai- This metro is just like an Airport. Escalators everywhere, clear directions of what is to be done, clean, fast, efficient. This Metro is some example of an infrastructure project pulled off brilliantly. 3. Clean and green: Delhi is real clean. Some say its cus of the CWG for which the city had got its act together. And Delhi has plenty of vast expansions of land that gives it a very open feel and never cramped.4. F1 circuit (when the race is on)- Not visited this place, though had plans, but my friends tell me this was some experience. So do try and catch it. This is in greater noida - Travel by Metro5. Taj Mahal - this isnt delhi but suggestively, if you're on a visit, do try and take the 4 hour train journey or 3 hr by car, to Agra so that you can visit the Taj Mahal and other monuments.What you should skip?1. Feroz shah kotla palace - This place is of historical significance though doesnt have much in terms of great architecture.2. Jantar Mantar - Bang next to Central park or connaught place, this might be ok only for kids3. karims - heard so much about this place -Was rated several times as India's most popular restaurants by Time, nat geo etc. - This place is just crap. I mean real crap.  The food is just average in fact bordering close to being bad given the hype and coverage the place receives. The place might have some good seekh kababs though which are good but nothing like a "world class" experience or an experience which the mughals would have. 4. Lotus Temple - Unless you're the spirituality seeking kinds, you can skip this place5. Noida/gurgaon - Though these are places people dont generally visit but an outsider mabe be tempted to explore it considering that its pretty well known or heard of. 6. Concert - If there is an international best seller coming to delhi then just forget it. .Only go there if its a Daler mehndi show!How does one travel to Delhi?Train obviously is the best option. Ticket costs anywhere between Rs 600k to 1.5k(from Mumbai)- Air tickets are the most expensive on this route- But if you book early, the flight cost can be anywhere between Rs 2.5 k to 4 k. Else 8k or 15k if you're doing it a day or two in advance. Where do I stay in Delhi?Paharganj- This place is 30 mins from the airport and just 10 mins from the New Delhi Railway station. 20 Min walk from Connaught place so perfect location. Also Paharganj is like a Mini stripped down version of las vegas with budget Hotels, hotels and more hotels everywhere! Room rates would range between Rs 1000 -Rs 1200 per individual per person for A/C room and Rs 500 and above for Non-a/c. This is a no brainer place to just lodge in. Hotel I stayed in was Hotel Sunder- Cheap budget hotel with free airport pick up, clean and well maintained and decent service.Paharganj is also close to the metro and Rajiv Chowk which is the metro station from where you can travel to any part of delhi be it Noida or Gurgaon. How do I see the place? Any guided tours?Yes - There is this HO-HO bus or Hop on and Hop off bus. Very good service I must say that was started during the CWG. The service is baschandru021y an A/C bus which goes to important tourist places and you can get off at a certain place. The next bus would come every 45 mins. The route covers all above mentioned locations and is the best way to see delhi. Also this bus costs only Rs 300 per person and is valid for 2 days. So in case you loved spending time at a certain place, you could visit the rest the next day. A must tryFood in Delhi?This is where the locals could help you when you're looking for streetside food. Breakfast in Delhi would be the usual Chole Bature which can be found anywhere. If you're looking at a decent lunch/dining experience then other than Connaught place, you should visit Green park or Khaus kaus village. This place feels a little like 'Italy'. Several upmarket restaurants surrounded by cramped buildings but very good food. We had been to golconda restaurant- A Hyderabadi one and it was outstanding. When you're there, do check out Park Balluchi. I heard of the place before and it claims to be among st the best in India. (Couldn't try it though). Gray Grass is recommended as well.But dont visit Karim's or rather go with the least expectations and not succumb to the hype.Best Time to Travell Delhi?Now - or rather just prior to Diwali as the weather was just perfect. I mean just perfect. It was pleasant and you might not need a A/C room at night. Its not cold as well which otherwise Delhi is known for.Important (Quick) Notes1. The metro closes @ about 11.30 and travelling at night unlike Mumbai is bad in Delhi. So ensure if properly prepare your itinerary.2. This place just doesn't seem to be safe for women. Even connaught place looks deserted at about 11 pm. The place shuts down quite fast unlike Mumbai.3. Carry an address proof. - After the high court blasts, individuals have been asked to also carry their local address proof. Only photo ID wont suffice - This is required by all hotels before you lodge in.4. Ensure you ask a Local how much it would cost to travel to a certain place using a Rickshaw. Else, they could take you for a ride literally. In a nutshell -  A place you must visit given the rich history and its world heritage monuments that are made accessible given the faboulous infrastructure that Delhi has.I was in delhi for about 2 years so sharing with you some of the places I visited & also near by placesPrized possessions of Mumbai would be showcased in two days. Time for Delhiwallahs to kep a date with the churning that the city has been witness to -and well lit broad roadsamong others isthe envy of manyI had been told by many about grandeur of akshardham Delhi, I wanted to visit here since long  , but  it is today when  I got opportunity, a magical beauty , more beautiful  than Taj .Such type of construction in modern era is difficult to find.

I’m neither going to list down the 5 star hotels or tourist attraction you can’t resistvisiting. Rather in this review I intend to go brutally honest about this city.I’ll throw light on of the insights which a true Delhitian faces or feels aboutDelhi.  In fact I’ll suggest you to read itwith a free mind or else you’ll end up hating or loving this city !1.We, the Educated People– (our education system)We’ve over 1500 schools which may be at every cornerof the city and may be recognized or unrecognized. To help the students passtheir school/ college exams, I bet the number of coaching centers exceeds thenumber of “Pan Vala” in the city. All the trees are tied with their silly adsassuring the poor parents that their child will not only pass, but will getover 90%. We’ve number one university of Asia in Delhi – DELHIUNIVERSITY. DU has round about 62-65 colleges,  where neither the professors are willing toteach nor the student are willing to study. We’ve the hub for commerceeducation. For example Laxmi nagar supplies CA’s, CS’s etc to the whole county.They themselves might not be CAs , but will guarantee to make you one. Now howcan I resist telling about the cream part ! every locality has a coaching centerwhere you can get a post graduation degree even if you did not pass your 6thclass exam  – All this at a veryreasonable price, and what’s more ? you get additional discounts if you get them2-3 more of such students.2. Beggary, Slums, Maids and their AdamsIn beggary we’re growing our scope everyday. You namea place, and they’ll after you. Red lights, near temples, restaurants, busstations, railway stations, public convince(loo) and where not. I remember onceI was joyfully licking my Mc Donald’s Soft cone, while waiting for a friend outside.A strange looking girl of about 10 years came near me, asking me to give a noteof Rs.10. Being a wise girl ;-) , I ignored her completely and carried on withmy work. To my surprise she snatched my soft cone leaving me a state of competeshock ! in Delhi the industry of beggary is ever mounting. Mind it, they aren’tall that poor or naïve as they appear. In slums, we can’t compete withAsia’s number one slum i.e. in Mumbai, but ya we aren’t any less. These daysmetro is running in all veins of Delhi, and so is the scope of slums. Maids-Delhi maids have real attitude problem, they’re the picture of trueModern Indian woman coming from all the states. I can cite my maid’s example, sometimesI seriously doubt  that she is richerthan her employers. She’s recently bought a house of her own of Rs. 7lahks andstill owns some 3lakhs as cash and lots of gold. She’s a member of 3 kitties inwhich she can raise huge amount of cash. How independent ! she’ll take 4-7leaves in a month without giving us an intimation of her resting time. ….Andtheir Adams- here adams symbolizes drivers, watchman and rest alike. Theyappear to be really poor and honest. Obviously (appearing) very loyal to theiremployers. You give them an old shirt, they’ll smile in front of you but makefaces at your back and might even throw the same shirt in the nearest dustbin.3. Something gold ! oops ! I mean oldHere old and gold symbolizes some old and very badlyconstructed places.  These oldies includeConnaught place (better known as cp where people cant be caught if lost !)  , Chandni chock, ( it isn’t Chandni Chock ofk3G of karan johar). Chandni chock is indeed a place famous for bride and groomdresses , food and lastly for being exceptionally dirty place. I happen tovisit Chandni chock on a rainy day, after that I couldn’t dare ! old alsoincludes a number of forts and historical monuments which are cleaned only onnational days like 26th jan and 15th aug. story ofunlimited temples , mosque and gurdwara is quite known.4. “Newer” DelhiNewer Delhi includes culture/places which have been newly adapted/established. Malls – we’ve in total 65 malls in Delhi and NCR. But I’vepersonally visited hardly 20 of them. Age old cinema halls like Priya, regal,liberty are out, new PVRs, Waves etc have taken the responsibility ofentertaining Delhi. Delhi Metro – this is one, against which I hold nogrievances and in fact I truly respect. We’ve Delhi Metro to boost about whichis not only very modern and speedy but it’s also very classy helping us controlour ever mounting traffic. Nehru place, Lajpat Rai market and Gaffar marketoffers you a market for computer accessories and other electronics at anunbelievable price. Where else can you find 2gb ipod of just Rs.750? NewerDelhi also include Chains like Mc Donald’s, Big Bazar, Vishal, Subhiksha storesand Reliance Refresh.5. Age old shoppersDelhitians are famous buying anything and everything. Wegen-x people don’t hesitate buying caps of 1800 from malls which otherwisewould cost 70-100 ! we shop from malls, markets and local markets we’ve hugemarkets like lajpat nagar, sarojni nagar, laxmi nagar, Delhi haat etc… we alsohave a range of local market (e.g. Mondays, Tuesday, Wednesday market) I know Imay be sounding quite funny but we’ve all this. We’ve huge industries of shopsthat survive on streets. Yes, you got me right I’m talking about street vendersetc . they can make you anything that’s highly useless  with their very high influencing power. Vendersat red fort, Chandni chock, Palika Bazar will acknowledge foreigners more thanIndian, obviously charging them the double amount for their extra-sweetservice.6. We, the Travelers (our transport system )We travel by private conveyance, public conveyance (busesand autos) and the latest Delhi Metro. Private conveyance is quite private butit has given Delhi it’s unlimited traffic. Public conveyance can give you lifelong experience. DTC and private blue line buses which are always over- crowded.They stop at each and every stop making your journey unbearably long andtrying. Auto vala’s are in their own world and may charge you Rs.70-100 for adistance of 6km. Delhi Metro I’ve already talked 7. Our NatureLastly I want you to know how the Delhitians are. We’refriendly.Yes ! extra friendly ! we become friends with teachers, professors andprincipal sir/ madam, We do so , to do away with our short of attendance orgetting our marks increased in exams. One of my friend is dating with hiseconomics teacher, she even gave him a branded shirt of Rs. 2100. That’s quitecool ! We become friend with superiors or bosses for unlimited reasons. We evendon’t mind becoming friends with an old neighbor (whose daughter/son is hot). If You Are Looking For Hotel Then I think Best Way to Stay in Service Apartments in Delhi, Here You Can Find More than 1000 service apartments but their is only palm greens service apartments I like very much n this is very much affordable .Its near to airport n avail transportation n accommodation facilty .Delhi, capital city of the Federal Republic of India. It is one of India's fastest growing cities. It has sprawled over the West Bank of the river Yamuna, straddling the river. The city has two distinct parts, Old Delhi & New Delhi. Delhi is the second most widely used entry point into the country, being on the route of most major airlines. Delhi- the commercial hub has many tourist attractions to offer. Visit vibrant shopping complex of Connaught Place, Delhi Haat for handicraft goods and delicious food bonanza. Pay a visit to Red Fort and Qutub Minar to view the excellence of Mughal architecture.Or just drop in at Janpath- for buying a variety of cheap and best items. If you are looking for spiritual peace, visit Lotus temple, which is also famous for its marvellous architecture and heavenly beauty. Take a stroll at Rajpath. Or pay a visit to India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhawan for viewing monuments made during British era.TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION Air: Delhi is well connected with major cities in India and world. Rail: Delhi is the headquarters of the Northern Railway and is well connected with all of the major places in India. A beautiful palce and of-course the capital of India. It is a city where you can find dynasities rising and falling, all at one stop. Be it the Slaves, the Tuglaks, the Mughals or the Britishers, its a place where you can warm your eyes with not only the scenic beauties but also appreciate the creation of God. Its a city where great empires have grown and collapsed. Being the heart of the nation, the nerves run down the spine on the thought of the rustless Iron Pillar.New Delhi. The city is fascinating, troubling and exhausting all at the same time.'' ~postcard with a picture of the Taj Mahal from a friend who seems to travel a lot lately and was very sweet to send me a postcardDelhi is a major travel gateway into India. It is one of India's busiest entry points for overseas airlines and is on the overland route access across Asia.

I like Delhi very much. Delhi is one of the metropolitan city in India and Delhi is the capital of India. Delhi, being the capital of India, many tourists from each country visits Delhi. They also like Delhi very much. In Delhi, there are various places to visit in. There are very big restaurants in Delhi also like Taj Hotel, Le-Meridien , The Oberoi Hotel and so on. From all the states of India, people came to Delhi in search of their job. In Delhi, we find all the people of different states who stays here. In all, we can say that, Delhi is  a mini India.If you raed the comment in the title review '' DELHI Dil walon Ki '', its a comment which you can say right or wrong. In Delhi some people believes in sharing, helping other poeple. On the other side, life in Delhi is very fast. Nobody has time to help other people. Every one is very busy in there life. But still Delhi is the city of food, Shopping malls, Historical places, etc. Most sought after in area around - if ur staying in delhi ncr region ,it is most sought    after place as its associated with history  otherwise it being capital of india an average citizen has a curiosity to explore what delhi is all about.Hi,i m giving my review on New Delhi...Seriously, Delhi is a place where life moves on and on and From early in the morning till late night...People can come to Delhi,Especially to South Delhi and Central Delhi where Delhites are busy in Weekdays and they get time to enjoy their weekends with their families or with their beloved...ya,sometimes Delhi becomes very busy,But even then people living in Delhi or people coming from outside get time to visit places like India Gate...which is a History...but have life today also...People living here are busy in there day today life but they are always ready help others...Management of Delhi is Very good...I dislike here in Delhi-Traffic jams sometimes becomes unbearable and sometimes the Taxi vaalaas demand for lot money and try to fool us...but I like the places like India Gate,Lotus Temple,Hotels,Parks,Akshardham Temple and many more places...So all people living in Delhi and coming to Delhi,my heartiest Welcome and Wishes to everyone...New delhi as the name itselfs suggests its new all type unique across india as capital city of country and have regionals firm climate the winds prevails from himalayas reaches sorroudings and its region is very warm n humid climate types thers so many wonders places here to visits all are beuatyfuly engulfed by asi archelological survey of india and many places realted to mughals so its all attractions about the way of transportaions here likes metros trains,lifeline buses ,autos compilled by cng polluition free era ,taxi travelings site seeings ,and very attarctive and cheap stay and well acomodatiosn avaiables on very aforadbles rates its very nice experiances to visits delhi the most sharing is to visit historical monoments likes red fort ,jama masjid,qutab minar and its well coordinated by todays outlets may great shopping malls today introduced where u may find all necessity products under 1 roof u find cine plex there and good fast foods to eat .its all loving nad caring too.Delhi, has seen the rise and fall  of many empires which have left behind a plethora of monuments that the grandeur and glory of bygone ages . A city which traces its history to Mahabharata, the great epic tale of wars fought between  estranged cousins , the Kauravas and the Pandavas for the city of Indraprastha.Delhi, the capital of India, is the heart of India, Also said like, ''Dilli hai Dilwalon ki'', means that Delhi belongs to people with hearts. Delhi Apart from being a political capital to most of the past rulers, is also a capital of India. Delhi is a major travel gateway into India. One should visit places like Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Raj Ghat, Jantar Mantar, Lakshmi Narayan Temple, Qutab Minar, India Gate, Secretariat Building, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Parliament House, National Museum, Lotus Temple and Markets like Sarojani Nagar Market, Karol Bagh, Chandni Chowk, Janpath and south extension. These are the most happening places in Delhi. The hotels accomodation available in delhi can be as cheap Rs 200 in Paharganj Area to As high as Rs 8000 per day in Taj. Delhi is also known for its famous food joints, like haldirams, where you can get to have the variuos delicious north indian preprations.DELHI-INDIAN CAPITAL As is with every head of the family, Delhi has its own unique character and individuality. Romans used to make fountains in the centre of their cities with a colonnade (pillar) Byzantine cities has a oblique (stone pillar)Hindus built temples as centre and Muslims built Mosques, the Kings to make events memorable used to erect a structure in the city of their residence. That is how we have monuments like Charminar, Qutub Minar in Delhi, monuments are spread all over Delhi, and there is tons of it, oh!! Many tons of them all worth a see.Qutub Minar is one such structure to go from India Gate by a CNG run Auto, it will charge around Rs.150/-, it was built, mended, added to by many rulers of old, it was struck by lightning also, This Minar has nice example of Indian Workmanship, don’t forget to take a closer look at the Alauddin Khaliji Gate near Qutub Minar, its carvings are exquisite and awe inspiring, Qutub Minar is decorated by verses of Holy Quran, The verses carved in stone by Hindu Construction workers are a fascinating past of India. I am not going to talk about monuments of Delhi, I will talk about the people of Delhi today, I saw many of them, they left a very good impression on me, what catches anyone first in this city is its aromatic air, do not forget to smell the air of Delhi, it has sweet smell a very astonishing fact, I guess from the gardens spread with thousands of trees everywhere. Majority of buildings in this city are spread horizontal, big wide houses, names of roads and streets of this city leave a smile on your face, Archbishop, Maharishi, Shershah, Kisan ghat, General, Safdarjung, Moad these are unique and reflective of Delhi, every other car here has (Tricolor) flag flying from the bonnet, every board around is the head office. Vertical Delhi is found on Connought Palace, I am sure there is somewhere here the palace of Lord Connought, here all buildings are vertical, and it’s the commercial and shopping hub. Come here to feel and see colors and people of this city. Delhi has many horizontal spread houses and there are many buildings called Hyderabad house, Kerala House, I guess all states maintain houses like these in the capital. There is Srilankan Mission and there are so many reading rooms, I traveled to and fro a lot in this city, this is the visual account of Delhi which I could retain in my mind's eye, I am sure residents will have many more good things to say about Delhi. Look of things is very clean, stylish, official and important. The local Hindi dialect has a ''O'' in each word (Banaliyo) I have seen some residences in Sainik Farm and as well in Turkoman Gate area both sides of the coin are just fantastic. People here are exposed to so many dignitaries and heads of states they are very appearence conscious, it’s evident in life styles, clothes, colors, make, art and crafts everywhere in houses, in shops in general and in particular. Workmanship is very through here, anything can be replicated here. Bus service, Auto, Taxis, Rickshaw, Horses, Cars and many other transport means prevail here, all public transport is run on CNG gas. This is helping in environment and this could be one reason for the nice smells here. Serving Hot rotis is a mode in all big and small hotels, roti size are small and very eatable, Winter is very cold even washing hands require hot water, this has made the people here very fair colored, sharp noses and very good looking generally. I cannot forget the very attractive, good looking faces of ladies I saw there. Angular face is many as opposed to round faces in the South of India. Food is a bit costly and transport cheap compared to south. I will extend my stay in Delhi for one reason to see more pretty faces and smell of aroma in the air. We have eat street in Hyderabad, Delhi's eat street is Yousuf Sarai Road, I took back from this city full stomach, nice smells, clean people, visions of proud nosed fair colored people. Delhi has good manners and not only that people here know what are good manners and appreciate very much good manners, no door is difficult to open, you are welcome everywhere even a hard selling salesman like me with a knowledge of good manners. Yo!! India Delhi has style and etiquette.Every places have their positive and negative points. I am writing a honest review of what I experienced in Delhi. It may be possible that I have come across most of the negative things and very less Positive things. So, if any die hard fan of Delhi wants to criticise for me this.....you are most welcome....The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder...-- Unknown.::: ||  DELHI  || :::Another review on places to be visited around Delhi/while in Delhi.Delhi itself has many places of tourist attractions, so why would anybodybother or find time out to visit places around it?More often it so happensthat we tend to procrastinate thinking ’’Paas hi tho hain kabhi bhi Dekhlenge’’(as it is nearby, we can visit anytime). But I can bet very few people areable to materialise such travels.''Yeh Dilli hai veer jawano ki.............deewano ki mastano ki.......iss capital ka yaaron kya kehna........!!No doubt Delhi is a beautiful place to visit.......(only if you've learnt judo-karate in school!!coz:crime rates here are real high.....and probably the amongst the other capitals!!)Life in this capital is like a masaledaar movie ..it has all the ingredients!!Delhi is known for it's monuments........I dont feel like writing about them!!!(school mein par hi liya hoga!!)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Delhi & its people:Delhites have been wrongly given the title of being egoistic!!Infact I believe they are the sweetest people around.....any questions??You can rarely find a Delhite who dosent like Delhi!!New Delhi, the pride of India, has succeeded in becoming a world class centre of attraction. It has been recognised in various platforms of interest, inviting attention from highly reputed arenas. Mixed with a multi-cultural tradition it has shown versatility in pushing itself for heightened activities.Y! You forgot your password? No problem!I had the occasion to visit the capital city of India, New Delhi, a few times and my experience of those visits left me with a kind of mixed feelings of respect for the hoary past and a sense of disdain towards its dubious present.New Delhi , the capital of the ''REPUBLIC OF INDIA''. My last review on the Hollywood movie THE RING couldn’t get posted on the main page of the site due to some technical difficulties. Thus, many of you must have missed it. Do check it out whenever you get time. It's posted on my profile page.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------New Delhi – the capital of India. Whenever I think about New Delhi I find it very tough to make up my mind that whether it’s a good city or not. Then I think no city can be perfect. Each city has its own share of problems and same is the case with New Delhi. But why are the problems attached with New Delhi so complex and big in magnitude compared to the other cities? Maybe, because it’s the capital! But then the allure attached with Delhi also can’t be found in any other city.Delhiis an urban disaster in all sense. It is the most lawless city in India. Note the amazing contrast: There is extraordinary police protection for the few VIPs, and the rest of the city is virtually lawless. It is not our national capital, it is our crime capital. And what a big shame - Delhi is India's capital. Delhi's crowd is rowdy. They come to blows at the slightest provocation. This is unacceptable. Travel in a rickshaw and taxi and you will soon find out the meaning of hell. They will almost surely overcharge you, particularly if they find out that you are an outsider. There is no other so outsider-hostile city in India. Delhities boast about wide roads, better traffic management. Dig a bit deep and the skeletons will come out. Delhi's roads are better to serve the polititians and the beurocrats. The entire fund (almost) comes from taxes paid by citizens of other cities, most prominently Bombay. The output of Delhi to the nation is almost zero. Yet, it consumes the valuable resources. It is like a parasite of the nation. WhatDelhi has given to India is crime, shame and corrupted polititians. What it has taken from India is funds and taxes for better roads.Hi MSians as each one of you know that this is my first review on this site which I came to know through Google.com I thought why not utilize this opportunity to swank my home town where I was born and brought up NEW DELHI is the word on which I am really proud of.New Delhi, the pride of India, has succeeded in becoming a world class centre of attraction. It has been recognised in various platforms of interest, inviting attention from highly reputed arenas. Mixed with a multi-cultural tradition it has shown versatility in pushing itself for heightened activities. Formally known as the colosseum of politics it has emerged as the motivational factor for the Indian democracy.Delhi is basically divided into two parts: The Bottom LineDelhi is a place of historic interest. There are plenty of interesting things to see and I would highly recommend seeing Delhi to everybody at Mouthshut. Dilli ki sardi!!:New Delhi:Indian Capital,Language:-Hindi, EnglishTop Season:- October?March:New Delhi:Indian Capital,Language:-Hindi, EnglishTop Season:- October—MarchWith due regards to Kanika, I would say that her review on Delhi is very good but meant for ''5 Star'' class. I am staying in Delhi since last more 3 years now so have a mixed feeling of both being a ''guest'' as well as a local resident. I shall discuss Delhi for an average/slightly above average tourist or resident. Despite being most crowded city (in terms of vehicles in India) the best thing Delhi has is, more than 3 routes to reach a destination any where in Delhi just in case you find traffic crawling or not moving at all on one road. This is a real plus. Now something which most Hard Core Delhlite wont like (Please forgive me if I sound offending, but travel by BUS/Auto's, shop at markets like janpath, Lajpat nagar and don't but anything if you don’t like anything in a shop) and you will know what I am talking about.. It is a city of somewhat rude people. Blame it to the ''touch'' of language/accent of this region but that's the way they sound. Chapter One : Transport If you are a tourist DON'T TRAVEL BY BUS, Blue Lines (private operators are a nightmare, DTC is not much better)is a BIG NO. The private operators will get you on their BUS no matter if it is going south and you have to travel west, if they can make out that you are new to this city. When you will realize (after paying for your ticket), they will tell you to get down take bus # X that will take you where you wanted to go. FEMALES are not at all safe in these buses, even the staff on the bus will not let an opportunity go to tease you. Auto walla's are no different , they will ask you triple the fare and their union is so strong at places like Railway Station/Bus Stops that if you refuse to go by one auto because you think the driver is over charging, no other driver will offer you less fare. Meter is a joke for them, all have a standard response ''it's not working''. They are so arrogant that they will even insult you if you try to argue with them. But, since Taxies are expensive you will have to manage with these Auto's. And any ways even Taxi Driver's are like this. My suggestion is, If you have a planned outing the best thing to do would be to hire a Taxi from a local Taxi Stand. You can get a Taxi for Rs. 500 for 8 hours/80 Kms and Rs. 300 for 4 hours/40 Kms. They charge you on km/hour basis if any of these exceeds. If you have good money, call 1929 for Mega Cab, the most comfortable one. But, considering my salary I do not use it more than once a month. It costs you Rs. 15/KM. Chapter Two - Culture Delhi, despite being a metro city has a culture which doesn't really give you a feeling of being a metro (Except you stay in areas like zorbagh and go to ''Oberois'' only for your family lunch/dinners). more or less, people in one society know/meet each other. In private colonies, it's like a typical punjabi neighborhood. If you are a working women and want to stay alone in an apartment, you might find it difficult to get one for you. (except areas which are developing and are nearby good MNC's like Gurgaon). City hardly has any night life to offer (again, except you have enough money to spend in those expensive bar's and hotels, unlike Mumbai). Major reason for this are the highest level of security required for this capital city of India and second the ''Culture'' itself. Also, government is taking strange decisions to kill whatever nightlife this city have, such as the recent decision of closing the shops by 7 PM ( 7 PM? can you beat it, no one reaches home before 8 here after his/her office).However, Call Centers are rapidly changing the face of Delhi with youngsters from different cities making a mark of their own. Chapter three - Tourist Places Not much to talk about, there is enough data on net. A couple of Do's and Don’ts for tourists. Do's 1. Always carry water with you specially if you are visiting in summers2. Plan your trip keeping in mind the regular traffic jams. 3. Hire a Taxi before hand and make sure driver is not new to the city. Dont's1. If you haven't hired a Taxi and using Auto from one destination to other, quote 60% of what Auto Wallah has offered. 2. If foreigner, don't respond to  comments from ''locals''. 3. Don't stay in hotels nearby Railway Station (Pahar Ganj) if you are with family, they are cheap but you never know that there might be prostitution going on next to your room. Overall, Delhi is a nice place to be in after you know how to deal with all those whom I have mentioned above. The city is beautiful at night for long drives (specially the lutyen's Delhi).Delhi Is Not Far…I've received quite a few messages from fellow reviewers at Mouthshut.com asking for advice about travelling in New Delhi. I'm not a resident of the city, but as I spend most of my weekends there, I am something of a professional Delhi tourist. This is not the typical review of all the main tourist attractions, but rather, an indepth guide to having a fabulous time in Delhi. So if you're planning to visit the capital anytime soon, and want to party hard, allow me to offer my advice... Delhi meri jaan.. for delhities (i may be wrong in spellings) is a true jaan some may call out the highly polluted city.. with the trouble of transport etc etc but incidently I found delhi the best place to live in...Last evening, I looked out of my car window on the traffic light near Pragati Maidan while returning from office, and I was greeted by the spectacular vision of moon peeking through the high parapets of Purana Qila. Suddenly the traffic jam and the noise didn’t matter and I was lost in the magic of the moment. It inspired me to write about my beautiful city. My apologies if this review sounds like a personal account instead of a travel guide, but having spent the majority of my school years in Delhi, I  cannot help but discuss it from a personal viewpoint.Delhi – The City where sab kuch Ho jaata hai !!!New Delhi is not everyone’s cup of tea.  Either you love Delhi or you hate Delhi, but very few who have traveled around in India can ignore Delhi.  Besides being the Capital of India, it is so situated that anyone traveling from North to South or East to West invariably pass through Delhi.   I will not dwell on the history and the geography of Delhi as it can be found on any number of web sites or books.  I will dwell on what Delhi has meant to me.Arambhol Beach: We have visited to the place this is the best place according to me in india This is going to be a really long description. Start reading this if you hav enough time and patienc e. Goa – Dream Land of each and every youngster born on earth!!!!! We were eight guys…. 1) Sterin 5) Nirmal 2) Lijit 6) Moon 3) Prinson 7) Harilal 4) Vipin 8) Ashper Everybody was really excited about the trip. Friday, Day 1 Startup: We packed our luggage and started our cheers for Goa Trip with Green label Whisky on Aug 11 th at 6pm. Reached KR Puram in a city taxi at 7pm and checked train’s arrival time. It was really horrible when we came to know that its 3 hours late. Desperately we searched for a restaurant to have food and kill time. Saturday, Day 2 Hubli to Margoa n: At 11 am train reached Hubli. We had our lunch after starting from a station called Castle Rock. There after trains passed through lots of small cute tunnels. Nature was amazing all the way. It was really nice to view panoramic sceneries and cascading water falls. Way was very misty and foggy like one in Ootty or Kodaikkanal. We copied most of the scenes into our cameras.. Arambol- also known as Harmal in the local language is a long and wide stretch of beach in North goa. This Beach is roughly 32-33 kms away from Panjim. The route from Panjim to Arambol will set the mood to what lies ahead of you in Arambol. En route you will find things quintessentially Goan. Charming narrow streets, soothing greenery all around and peek-a-boo with the beaches. If you are on a bike- even better so! Be sure to go to Morjim beach too en route to Arambol. Its a lovely stretch and one of the lesser known secrets of North Goa! So what can one really expect in Arambol? Well to begin with- sun and sand, sun and sand and some more sun and sand! Yes, the beach is long, wide, clean and inviting, fringed with coconut trees. Also on the beach you' ll witness a rewind to the 60's & 70's hippies era as the place attracts many a firang backpacker. And as avid travelers would know- hippies of that era were known to be real "khojoos".Some of the most beautiful places in the world were discovered and brought into limelight by them- be in Goa, Manali, Thailand, Bali and so on. They definitely do have a taste. And so you will see in Arambol. The beach is way, way, better than its better known cousins in north Goa like Baga, Calangute, Vagator etc. However, there are few shacks on the beach and even fewer beach huts making this place kind of exclusive. Cocks town offers some decent beach huts and has a lovely shack. So does Mango tree, but I believe their rooms are not on the beach. The beach has some good waves during high tide and you will find an occasional firang surfer. This is the ideal place to just gaze, ponder, steal sweet nothings and discover your artistic side. You can do so over some great food at these shacks. We tried the schnitzels and grilled fish and they were pretty darn good.Even though with each passing day(and MS review maybe!) the place is getting discovered by people, I guess the beach is still huge enough to let you have the sense of space.You can spend a good 2 days at Arambol to get in touch with yourself. The nearby beaches of Morjim and Mandrem can also be easily visited. They too are lovely. The beach does not offer any water sports per se. So you ll have to keep yourself entertained. Its really a place for nature lovers, solitude seekers and some plain pondering. However, don't let me position this place as a bore- It really has a good party scene at night- albeit at a few available shacks. Some things to be prepared for- There are very few shops around so make sure you have the necessary things for a comfortable stay. Also, since its a relatively remote location, it would help to have personal transportation like a bike, scooty etc. The beach huts are mostly extremely basic; but clean. Some have common bathrooms and some attached- so do make all your inquiries before booking.So, the next time you are in North Goa and are pretty bored of what the Baga types have to offer, so hop on to Arambol. Its definitely worth the visit- even if for a few hours! Adios!Goa usually is a tourist hotspot for people in India and also outside India, especially during the new year time. The reason why Goa is loved by everyone is really simple which is they can have good and a wild time of your life leaving behind all the pressures people have in their life. The bad thing about having a vacation in Goa is that sometimes it can be really expensive, which brings me to my point.In 2009 summers, when all my friends were planning to beat the heat in delhi, I was all set to fly down to Arambhol beach.Best time to visit : November to February - Situated around 50 km north of Panaji, Arambol a small remote fishing village has one of the most charming beaches of Goa. The place has two beaches, more popular is the main beach (Harmal beach), the northernmost beach in Goa. Every tourists dream, the beautiful beach is secluded and has a primitive, untouched feel to it. The second, more picturesque beach lies beyond the rocky headband and can only be reached on foot and is bordered by steep cliffs on both sides. The main beach, on a long stretch of curving sand is good for swimming. It is a place ideal for people looking for peace and tranquility. A hot spring near the main beach which feeds into a freshwater lake, producing silt on the lakeshore said to be good for the skin, that some are fond of smearing on their bodies. On its immediate north there are several attractive, relatively quite bays and fresh water pools also good for swimming separated by rocky headlands. The headlands are made of basalt and are clearly visible for miles along the coast. A well made track runs round the headland to the second beach which is even more secluded and little used. The coastal path again continues round the next headland to the Terekhol beach, the northernmost tip of Goa on the Maharashtra border. Arambol village is quiet and friendly, with just a few hundred locals mostly fishing people. The place is ideally peaceful allowing you to have a close experience of local life and culture. The relaxed environment coupled with peace and tranquility attracts many vacationers from other beaches of Goa. The Harmal beach is 2.5 km from the village bus stop, down a road passing village houses sheltered under coconut trees. The rocky headland or the cliffs near the beaches are popular for paragliding. Dolphin watching boat trips and paragliding are amongst the fun activities on this beach. Boat trip to Anjuna beach are also available. A few shops sell clothes, junk jewelry and handicrafts from across Goa and India. Some good cafes along the main beach and on the headland to the north serve up tasty dishes from the cuisine of Italy, Goa and India.

Its awsome place to visit atleast once in  a yearJust return from Goa on 7th Jan 2016 after 5 days tourism. Even January month is not pleasant there, weather is too hot.  It is necessary to take AC hotel there. Food is too costly   but tasty. Street food is surprisingly not easily available but you need to search for it . After 7 pm, the cities look like "curfew going to start" and majority shops are closed . Streets are empty. Sea Beach s  are closed after the Sun set with no street lights available. Compare to Chennai, Puri or Degha, Goa beaches seems to be more conservative. Domestic tourists are mad about white skin tourists, if they can catch any white tourist, than literally forced them to take selfie with them self and with with whole family & friends. I do not know whether this white skinned tourists fell annoyed or fell celebrity short of thing!  I am expecting some short of Night life in Goa but not visible . Govt Tourist packages are very good and worth. Goa Govt hotels are costly but locations are extremely good. The cheap hotels are always far way from the beach. Local transportation is another problem. Taxi service is easily available but rates are not negotiable and ready to hole your pocket . Nobody follow State Govt fare list, this is on paper only.  I feel, if Terrorist issue in Kashmir decrease and tourism will encourage by J & K Govt, than Goa will run for its money. India's 50% tourism revenue can easily  go to J & K, if Goa etc will not review its Tourism policy.Like all other people I went to goa to have fun with my friends.The place was really good and I was enjoying a lot.Goa  mean`s  a  lot  of  fun I like  goa  so  much  and  if  anybody  who  has  not  visit'ed  goa  you  should visit  because  its  coll  and  a  lot  off  fun  in  goa there  are  lot  off  turist  goa  is  all  about  the turism I love  goa  beach's  there  are  so  many Butiful  beach's  chalangute  beach  colva  beach  vagator  beach  baga  beach  and  so  many  other  beach's  and  there  are  a  lot  of  big  n  old  church  and  also  there  is  lake  called  the  ganesh  tullem  there  are so  many  big  ship  casinos  like  Deltin  royal  there  is  a  fort  call  Agyara  fort  so  goa  is  sech  a  wonderfull  place  to  anjoy  so  that's  why  I  love goa ??The call of Goa never ceases to cast its charm.

During this season, the countryside turns a lush green and plant life turns on its colors.  There are two distinct tourist seasons during which certain areas will noticeably fill with visitors.  These times of year occur during new year and xmus ie in Dec and January, and again during the month of May.

One of the best places to visit be it anytime of the year.It was March 1 2013, when I made my first ever trip to Goa and I was in my final year of engineering .All most all of my friends already made several visit to Goa and every time they use to return, they use to go gaga about this place.Sitamarhi: During my visit to Bihar last year I along with my friends visited Sitamarhi. We stayed at Hotel Ashirwad. According to a mythology, Mata Sita was born in an earthen pot under the land of this district, where her father Raja Janak found her while ploughing that land to seek the blessings of Lord Indra, for rain. Raja Janak dug a tank at that place and after the marriage of Sita, he placed the stone figures of Rama, Sita and Lakshman to mark the place.Mahasamund: Approx 60km from the Raipur;capital of Chhattisgarh,there is not much to look upto in the proper Mahasamund city.But in the nearby locations,there are peacefull green forest detinations.Life almost comes to haults there,so if you want just that,go ahead.You can stay in making some adjustment with the Irrigation Guest House.Don't try to search for a hotel there,if you want one then stay in capital Raipur(Hotel Babylon,Celebration).Nearby Locations :  Patora Dam,Singhora Devi Temple,Sirpur(Archeological Museum)Patora Dam needs a full day,cause if you want to enjoy tranquility,dont rush through.Just leave your baggage at the Irrigation rest house,ask them to prepare whatever minimum they can make & leave for the Dam.Listen to the birds,tree leaves,water & silence.Singhora Devi temple is located in a  hillock on the way from Mahasamund to Sirpur.I felt the best there,it depends with which mood you go there & whats your expectation from the place.You will barely see any human being there,except the saint who spent his whole life collecting money for buliding this temple in an isolated forest place.Silvassa: I had been on a trip to silvassa in October 2013.We had gone for an industrial visit.We had stayed at hotel plaza.We had scheduled for 2 days and had hired a bus.Silvassa is the capital of Dadra and Nagar Haveli a Union territory. Ruled by Portugese until 1954, and later by local tribals, it is located between Maharashtra and Gujarat. The nearest rail head is Vapi, 17 km away. By road it is 180 km from Mumbai and 120 km from Surat.Benaulim Beach: We that is about four families with kids a total of 13 members stayed in Royal Goan resort in Benaulim. The beach was what we wanted, Uncrowded, without any loud music, or drugs imbibing phirangi's etc. it is actually a family type crowd which was there all the time.Colva Beach: Colva beach is very nice beach in goa its nice place I am gone that beach 2-3 times in a year its very cool place in goa you like to go with friends & girlfriend for fun the goa city is alcaholic free you & your friends can enjoy so much in colva beach its water was so cleared you can swimg , surf & enjoy boting with your friends or girlfriend & do what ever you want to do in beach its all free in goa city, nice safety in goa beach there hotels is so niceGoa is the paradise, for persons who love beaches, seashore, white sand and bikini.Colva happened to us as an accident , but we do not repent for going to Colva . Colva is the longest beach in Goa . It is very close to Madgaon . It is known by various names at different places like Sernabatim , Benaulim etc .Hi all, actually our rip to goa was for 8 days we were covering all the beaches at goa and once we visited to colva beach and flattered to see it for the first time as it is very long beach and depth in water from shore is straight and not deep from starting so that we can go more in to the water. we spent almost 2 hours that day and we immediately planned to spend last 2 days of our trip at colva beach. Like we have planned we moved to colva beach just days before we leave goa and stayed at a 3 star hotel which has swimming pool in it. we almost utilized the swimming pool timings and most of the time spent out time in water i.e  in beach. Near colva beach entertainment  channels are more. we have musical nights, shopping malls and disco theques and lots more.... we spent out last night completly roaming around the beach.Hi guys !! first of all I wd request u not to expect much as its a personnel experience cum review...  I wont improve ur GK but may give u useful tips, u will really find worth !!!see ! the first two reviews r great and they will tell u almost everything about the colva beach, how to reach , and all financial stuffs..Well what could be the best time of this year to visit goa than any other part of the year.  So what MSites are waiting for rush to the land of fun.Colva Beach is situated in South Goa about 7 kms from Margao/Madgaon. Colva is to South Goa what Calangute is to North Goa. However , while Calangute has golden sands , colva beach is famous for its silver sand. The best way to reach Colva is to ride a bus from Madgaon bus stand.The journey takes about 25 minutes and costs Rs 5.Miramar Beach: Miramar beach is one of the popular beaches in Goa. It is located in the Panjim city. From the Panaji bus stand it is about 4kms. You can take a bus, car, rikshaw or a bike to get here. Roughly it takes about 15min from the bus stand to get to the beach.There is place around the beach to park your vehicle.The Miramar beach is located about 3 kms from the Panaji City. It is also called as the Panaji's local beach. If you travel by bus from Panaji Bus Stand to Miramar it will cos you around 4 rupees while if you travel by rickshaw or taxi you wil have to pay around 40 rupees.Dwarka: Dwarka/NathdwaraGondal: Gondal isn’t a place that would be visited on its own, or figure high on a tourist itinerary. Nevertheless, whenever you are at Rajkot/ Junagarh in Gujarat and have half a day to spare, Gondal is not be missed. Palitana: Palitana is located in Gujarat, India. Palitana is the biggest Jain temple in India.Palitana is a town which is 50 kms away from Bhavnagar.Palitana is famous for its temples of Jain riligion.Somnath: Please dont go to safari hotel at Somnath, These guys are useless in terms of serive. The moment u check out and want to use the loo in the room, you will be turned away. While the religious and historical significance of Somnath temple is the prime factor drawing visitors to the place, the location also has a scenic charm of its own. The sea surrounds it on three sides, and the sound of the waves breaking on the shore is quite calming. Equally invigorating is the sight of rising and setting sun and moon; the moon especially on a full moon night. However, Somnath as a town is rather disappointing. It is a mostly slum-like settlement, with shanty houses, trotting pigs, open drains and much filth.Our tour plan is Pune – Somnath –Dwarka – Mumbai –Pune /Our train Pune-Veraval express reached Veraval at 5:00 pm.  After getting down the Railway station, as usual Auto Riksha peoples will come to you to take you to Hotel & Temple.  This is our first mistake where we listen to Auto Riksha guy. We got into the Auto Riksha and asked him to drop at Somnath trust office to get an accommodation in trust guest house.  Auto Riksha guy is insisted us to take a private guest house room which he claimed as cheaper and adjacent to temple.The Chennakesava temple of Somnathpura is an under rated, scaled down version of the magnificent Hoysala temples at Belur.Thank GOD, Somnathpur temple is under the care of ASI and there is no priest performing mumbo jumbo.( No insults intended, since I myself am a Hindu) This is perhaps the primary reason why the temple is maintained in pristine condition.  The landscaping is excellent and it attracts more foreigners than domestic tourists being closer to Mysore.  Vandalism is minimum on the temple.  Some portions  of the missing link have been replaced by ASI.Lord Somnath - Keeping the word. There is something about Somnath that keeps sending reminders that I need to keep my word. A word to Lord Somnath. A word to the entire confluence of thoughts that grip me when I am on a pilgrimage. This time round I was there for six days, each taking in its stride the highs and lows of life.  A day in Dwarka ( Aug. 10th) where the mood had yet to set in for Janmashtami celebrations, the commute to Somnath was via Porbandar.Somnath, the rise of phoneix, the story from rubbles to riches. Reconstrued by Sardar Vallabhai PatelSomnath is a pilgrimage beach located on the shores of Arabian Sea in Veraval City of Gujarat. It has one of the most speactacular beaches I have come across at least in Gujarat. The twin advantage of having a famous temple along with the beach definitely helps to add variety to your holidays. The newly constructed temple looks astonishing and also gives the calmth one usually searches for in pilgrim places. There is a constant chanting of ''rudrams'' in praise of Lord Shiva which adds to the glory and power of the place. The main idol faces east so the first ray of the sun falls on it and you wont want to miss this if you are to visit Somnath.  As soon as you come out of the temple there is a big lawn well maintained for having a stroll. You can spend hours here without doubt. Every evening, the temple is lit wonderfully with decorative lights. This starts at around 7 till 9. Its worth seeing. SomnathLegends & HistorySomnath at Patan, near Veraval in Gujarat is a pilgrimage centre held in great reverence throughout India and is considered to be the first of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Shiva. Somnath is situated on the south coast of Saurashtra and a hallowed province of present day Gujarat, mentioned even in Puranas.Legend has it that the Kalabhairava Shivalinga (Bhairavanatha) at Prabhasa was worshipped by the Moon God, and hence Shiva here is referred to as Somnatha. The Skanda Purana describes the Sparsha Linga of Somnath as one bright as the sun, the size of an egg, lodged underground. The Mahabharata also refers to the Prabhasa Kshetra and the legend of the Moon worshipping Shiva.Now for another digression! Legend goes that the moon was married to the 27 daughters of Daksha Prajapati. He was partial to Rohini, his favourite and neglected the others. An angered Daksha cursed him to wane into nothingness. A disturbed Chandra, came down to Prabhasa with Rohini and worshipped the Sparsha Linga of Somnath after which he was blessed by Shiva to grow and shine in the bright half. As the moon regained his light here, this town came to be known as Prabhasa. Brahma, one of the trinity, installed the Brahmasila, and paved way for the construction of the temple.The glory and wealth of Somnath was described by the Arab traveller Al Biruni, and his accounts prompted visits by various invaders leading to repeated destruction and reconstruction of this famed temple. In the year 1783, Queen Ahilyabhai Holkar built a new temple nearby, and in 1951, the president of India re-installed the Jyotirlingam of Shiva on the same Brahmasila on which earlier temples had been built. The present day temple is a majestic marble and stone structure. Entrance to the town of Somnath is through the Junagadh Gate. There are also the remains of an ancient Sun temple at Somnath. To the east of the town is the Bhalka Theertha connected with the legend of Krishna's final departure from the mortal world.Hissar: Hissar is the city of Haryana India.I visited this place with my friends.I am very much enjoying in this place.Lahaul & Spiti: I voyaged throughout Himachal including Lahaul,Spiti What's more Kinnaur.Rohtak: Rohtak district is one of the 21 districts of Haryana state in Northern India. It is located in the southeast of Haryana and northwest of Delhi, bounded by Jind and Sonipat districts to the north, Jhajjar and Sonipat districts to the east, and Hissar, Sirsa, and Bhiwani districts to the west. Rohtak city is the district headquarters.Muslim masons did all the decorative work in stone and fabricated wood crafted door sets in these havelis.Vagator Beach: Vagator beach is very clean and not very crowded as compared to Baga& Anjuna. Its gaining popularity and lot of tourists throng here but it is still clean and quiet.I am a huge fan of Goa and have been visiting this place every year from past 5 years now. This year as well, my friend informed me about Great Live Music Festival at Baga Beach, best of Rock and Fusion and Jazz from across India and Russia. Hi, I am a travellr, I liked travelling. I have visited many things in India, but the one & only one which Ilike most is GOA. I visited GOA first in 1974 with my parents. Then till last year I had visited 7 times since then with my families. I am a member of Sterling Holiday Resorts, so GOA's resort is my another homw as such. It is situated very close to Vagatore beach. My last trip was last year with my family & we stayed there for 7 days. I visited all the places there, including the Temples, Churches, Beaches, Lake etc, did shoping also. But as a specific location I like this beach very interesting as we were staying there only. We reached here late night at 8.30 from Pune due to rain in between, but the trip was so exciting, we can never forget it.Vagator beach is undoubtedly one of the best beaches in Goa. Full of enchanting scenes, one can spend the whole day just admiring nature. You can take a bus from Mapusa to reach there. If you have your bike, the best route to take is via DM's college. Lonely road with negligible potholes, I am sure you will enjoy the ride to the beach. You can also reach the beach if you are going northwards from the capital city of Panaji. Take the left from Porvorim near the junction at hotel coqueiro. I would not advise you to take this route though...Vagator Beach is a picturesque beach located in North Goa.This beach is famous for its tranquility and natural scenery. Vagator beach may be reached by bus from Mapusa Bus Stand. The fare is 6 Rs. The bus does not drop you on the beach but on the road leading to Vagator beach. From there its about 1.5 km walk to the beach. Hence if you are traveling with a senior citizen or someone with a walking disability I would advise you to take a taxi from Mapusa rather than travel by bus.Bhavnagar: When I had visited to Bhavnagar with my family . for some religious function. I had visited Victoria Park. which is located almost in the middle of the city.  As I had heard about the bhavnagar . that is is not a big city. but I was surprised that. it has got a very big park in the bhavnagar.  its a mini forest in the city.Dangs: Had visited saputara last year. Saputara is the only gujrat's hill station( as far I know about gujarat) . Saputara comes under dangs district. It is located on the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra.Dangs is a district in Gujarat, almost on border of Gujarat-Maharashtra. One of the unexplored places for tourists, you can visit this place in a group. It gives you an insight of how these villagers live and what is actually a village life. We went there in a group of 10 with a guide. The local adivasi people there are also very helpful. We planned our trip during Amavasya as that night the place has the most beautiful view and there are many people who visit this place to look out for constellations and stars and few planets. In fact we spotted so many jugnus(fireflies) here. Our children were just delighted. We had taken a train to Saputara and then drove down here. I would not recommend this place for children below 6 years. There are many tour groups who also take you for excursions here, so if your child is old enough and you don't have any group join them to explore this place. The local people take you even to forest and give you lot of info on the trees and spotting birds and wildlife and on their living. It could be an educational trip for your child and even for you. I believe government should take some steps to develop this place but without disturbing the nature and the simple life of those adivasis.Kutch: The great rann of kutch is the world's largest salt dessert that measures about 16, 000 sq kms of absolutely blinding whiteness .Kutch is famous for its white salt desert. I had visited there in kutch festival., there was dandiya going on. Music is on. So many artificial lights. A environment of Mela.Rajkot: Rajkot is the fourth largest city in the state of Gujarat. Rajkot is one of the top fastest growing city in the world. Rajkot also falls in the list of top 10 cities in India.Bilaspur: Bilaspur is a very old city of chhattisgarh. This place is well known for it's ancient fort and temples such as ratanpur's devi temple is very famouse among them this temple is about 1500-1600 bc old.Biaspur is one of the big cities of chhatisgarh state. I went to bilaspur with my father for a business trip in 2008 . the hotels are good and available in reasonable price.  bilaspur is an great city with great culture and coutesy of people.Dalhousie: I have visited Dalhousie last months with my family.  I have gone their from New Delhi, by train, the nearest railways station is Pathankot from where I take private taxi for reaching Dalhousie.  I arrived their in the evening where I have already booked a hotel there which provide us very good and comfortable room and there was also a restaurant on the roof of the hotel, I enjoyed there very much.  The weather of Dalhousie was very cold and on the same night there was a nice snow fall started.  When we wake up in the morning all the hotels, roads and greenery of nearby covered with full of white snow.  The weather becomes very romantic and pleasant. I enjoyed the snow fall there very much.  I have stayed there four days.  I visited the places of interest like Dainkund Peak, Khajjiar, Dalhousie cantonment, Punchpula, Tibetan Market and thereby local market.I can travel to Dalhousie in 2011 in my school tour to chamba.We firstly tour the Banikhet which is 6km below from the Dalhousie.Dalhousie is situated in the Chamba district of Himachal pradesh Its a beautiful natural place where the unbeatable beauty of the nature lived.Dalhousie is a hill station its situated in mossorie, himachal Pradesh  .this place is  very beautiful and its completely covered from natures .in this place we see a lot river, canel nd its a  honeymoon destination nd we go here wth our family nd friends .nd we get peace nd noise free enviourment nd atmosphere .I have to see where many type of  trees nd flowers nd I like this all  nd this place is  very secured  nd hotel are very beautiful we go here from bus , car nd other transportation.I feel good nd owesoam to visit this placeDalhousie is hill station in chamba distt and situated on the top of the hill in the state of Himachal Pradesh. It is 2400 mtr above sea level. This is the main center of attraction point for the tourists.Dalhousie is simply the heaven on earth. A hill station of its one kind different from those like shimla, mussorie etc., a pollution free place to relax and chill in holidays. If you want complete peace for some days during holidays.Dalhousie is the place to visit.Dalhousie is a hill station in Himachal Pradesh situated between 6, 000 and 9, 000 feet i.e 2, 700 m above sea level. The best time to visit is in the summer, and the peak tourist season is from May to September.We went to Dalhousie on the way back from visiting Dharamshala so we could show our son the snow. We went during January and were not sure of the weather. We get into Dalhousie through Amritsar(200 kms.). Around 6 hrs journey from Amritsar International Airport. Never approach prepaid taxi counter as they charge double. We could arrange a Travera at half the rate(~3600 /-) by internet quotation. Hotels near subash chowk are good. In non season it can be bargained. We stayed at Hotel Dalhousie Palace. While visiting dalhousie if you have missed a stay in Aamod, I am sure you have missed something you never want to. Aamod has a scenic beauty you will cherish once you are there. You get views of the pir panjal range.This is a place for those who are looking for freshness, peace and a break away from the noise, pollution and overcrowded Delhi. Really it was such a trip that I would never forget for the soberness and cold climate. My journey started from Delhi by train to Pathankot and them by bus to Dalhousie which took almost 4hours on a steep hill ride.We went to Dalhousie after visiting Vaishnodevi enroute to Manali.  We took a bus from Pathankot and reached Dalhousie in 4 hrs.  After checking out few hotels we checked-in at hotel Gaurav for 2 days which is behind Kumar Resort (550/-) at the busstand and got a clean n neat room with balcony opening on the valley. You don’t even require the fan here. In 3rd week of May the climate was pleasant.In Dec 24th, 2009 I moved to Dalhousie base camp(~5000ft) of Youth hostel association of India for a organized trek from dalhousie to Kalatop( 8000ft) to Khajjiar(~5000ft) to Oberi(~2000ft).  In the group I reported, total members are 61. One thing I want to reiterate here, it seems YHAI doesn't fix any upper limit to accomodate the number of person per group. What I saw there, they don't have the facility to provide a fair enough accomodation, sanitation facility and a hygenic environment to such a large number of people in a group at the destination except the base camp. THE TRIP:As a hill station, Dalhousie is something that really does not make you go ga ga over it. It does not have the exotic charm of a Dharamshala, nor the sheer majestic grandeur of Darjeeling.Nor does it have a picturesque lake like Nainital, nor unlike Ooty or  Kashmir  it is a popular movie location. But if you are idea of a vacation is just lazing around, taking leisurel walks, watching the sun set and being totally laid back, Dalhousie is the best place for sure. In a way Dalhouse is some what like Yercaud or Ranikhet, leisurely laidback places, which have often been overshadowed by their more glam cousins Ooty and Nainital. My visit to Dalhousie was way back in 2001, when my sister was in Pathankot. Apart from the fact that it has an army cantonment, Pathankot is like any other dusty, small town, one comes across in Punjab. But lying right next to the Himachal Pradesh border, makes this a popular starting point for people wanting to hit the Chamba area of Himachal Pradesh. Chamba is one of the oldest Indian kingdoms, and is the heartland of the Pahari culture. This district is located on the western edge of the Dhauladhar mountain range in the Himalayas, and that is where Dalhousie lies too.What Dalhousie..."that ghatiya jagah  wahan kyon?"This was the first comment  I got from a stranger on the train, when I told where I was going to go from Pathankot.For those of you who dont know Hindi-it means, that yucky place, but why?That comment put a knot in my stomach immediately and maybe prepared me for the place I was about to see.Maybe, just maybe I went there in the wrong season, but then I never expected it to be so hot.almost as hot as Hyderabad at that time.I was on a whirlwind tour of Delhi,Agra and Dalhousie in Independence Day week.I was in Dalhousie on 17th Aug 06 2:00pm, hot, no clouds, no breeze and feeling sick after being through a hundrend hair pin bends on the way up.This was not I expected, It was my worst Nightmare....first time in a North Indian hill station and its not cool, no way near cool and all the himalayas I got to see was huge grey rocks taller than anything else and which has no snow caps.I suppose I saw the wrong photos, read the wrong article in rediff and came at the wrong time.Triple whammy.Now what next...the knot in the stomach got tighter..I got a hotel recommended by my taxi driver..was decent enough.now I asked him to come back "tomorrow when I can think of anything other than a spinning head"Good soul he was, he promptly was back 10:am sharp and offered to give a tour for Rs:1200 , I very cleverly made him agree to do the job for a hundred rupees less.We saw lot of places with nice names and as small as your backyard and some as small as our Presidents' backyard.Things to see Dyan kund, Kalatop and especially Khajiar.All others on the pamplets are just commas and fullstops.It was hot, bright sun and a little breeze as you reach the top most point near an air force station and trek up a hill to see dhyan kund.By the way if you have cell you will see pak-tel signal on it here. Dont select it. OK.after the tiring trek, in your car you can see the dense forest.Khajiar will be pleasant surprise..to keep it that way,I will not tell you what you can see there.  The next moring was a surprise, no sun only dense white clouds..you can touch Misty, dark like a secret. ethereal..like dream.unfortunately I had to go...to Delhi. Better Luck next time. Say that to me OK.Hi,     I wanted to travel from bangalore to secunderabad on train and I have taken ticket which costed 180 rs for general ,but I know it costs only 150 when I asked in ticket counter he said the train is going in different root .There is a place called Prajpur near Palanpur. On the web site I saw a great visual and description of a hotel called @The udges Court@. I was so impressed that I send out a Demand Draft of Rs. 1000.Dalhousie is a quiet town, with a sense of enchantment. This hill station spreads over five low-level hills at the western edge of the Dhauladhar range, just east of the Ravi River. The picturesque town is interspersed with the colonial-era buildings, low roofed stalls and hotels. The pine-covered slopes around it are intersected with paths and treks, which are ideal for short undemanding walks.Dalhousie is a beautiful and refreshing place. I happen to be there in Feb, 2006. As it was not the peak season but still you will find decent tourists around. It is advisible to book your accomodation before going there. Summer heat drives the plainsmen high into the mountains but like herds of sheep they all run to Mussoorie, Nainital, Shimla. Its only the really wise men who move to places like Dalhousie.Dalhousie, a colonial station tucked away, far from the madding crowd. A place I will always remember and miss. It was where I met the person who made Dalhousie the magical place it is and was always meant to be.However Dalhousie is a place you go to when life takes you the brink of breaking. Walking up and down through the town is a pleasure. Visit the Sacred Heart Convent where you find a warm welcome from the Nuns. The more adventurous can take a hike to Khajjiyar. The floating islands are all they promise. A magical journey on a flying carpet. Every little boys fantasy come true. It is easy to imagine the days gone by when young englishmen would have been vying to attract the attention of the young lady they fancied.The town has a mystical charm all its own and remains my favourite holiday destination.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Dalhousie is one of the most serene and peaceful hill stations I have ever visited. The breath of fresh air, the view of majestic mountains peaked with snow, the gentle coolness of the weather all added to my wonderful experience.Despite the fact that it does not boasts of many tourist spots, yet just a walk across the mall road or a trek up the panch pulla is stimulating and gives you a lingering memory of the summer capital. The open vast fields of Khajiyyar, surrounded by jungle of pine and fir trees are a treat for the eyes that have been seeing the city traffic.Dalhousie , the hill station is not a very popular one. The reason is definitely not its serenity but may be its position. Tucked into Himachal Pradesh beyond punjab, is a place worth visiting. The beconing of vast virgin pine forest with a backdrop of majestic Himalayan ranges made it a very popular place among the people of old Raj.Dalhousie Standing at the foot of the spectacular Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas, is the popular hill station of Dalhousie, that covers an area of around 14 sq.km, and is sprawled over five hills Kathlog, Portreyn, Moti Tibba (formerly known as Tehra), Bakrota and Balun. A resort that still exudes an old worldly charm, Dalhousie has retained much of the British Raj style. I got married in the month of april.  In mumbai april is pretty hot and humid, so we have decided to goto place which is coooool.  We were planning to go to Mount Abu or Munnar, but on of my friend suggested dalhousie. He said is a must go place for honeymoon couple (and it is a must go place for honeymoon couple).Dalhousie, wow this place is indeed a JANAT in itself, believe me I've visited so many hill stations, but this place has damn good thing 'bout itself, the Ist and the best THING 'bout Dalhousie is that it is very less crowded and the people here are very descent, the nearest airpot is Kangra(Gaggal,12 km).I always wanted to go to some place where one could see everything covered with white carpet and the sun rising from behind the snow clad mountains. Every vacation I would request to visit such a place and for my every request, there would be prompt reply from my hubby “Oh!! Ice, (holding my hand he would take me in front of our fridge, open the freezer) here you can see it right here in our fridge, why do you want to travel so far at sub zero degree temperature.” And I wouldn’t know whether to laugh or get angry at this stupid joke!! Finally a week ago we got a chance to visit Dalhousie. Here I share my experience with u all…I'll always remember Dalhousie for the first (breathtaking!) view I had of the himalayas - early morning, in the midst of a snow covered youth hostel colonial wooden building. My last review on the movie “1942 - A love story” prompted me to dig out some details about the place where the whole movie was shot. And what else could be the best source of information about it, but a visit to the place itself. I started looking out for opportunities to see this small hill station nestled in lap of Majestic Himalayas. I didn’t have to wait for long, and soon I packed my bags and left for Dalhousie in cold month of December. But to my surprise, instead of a chilly weather, I got a bright sunny welcome at this beautiful hill town. Dalhousie is a beautiful virgin place to visit, full of lush green pine trees. It doesn't possess lots of spots but the charm of cool air greenery, lofty paths make it an ideal destination. Some 8 hours journey by car from Chandigarh via Pathankot, it is a place where not many people visit. Pathankot can also be reached by train from where rest of the journey has to be carried out by road. It’s a place that isn't expensive to visit with hotels available at reasonable rates. Peak season to visit is summers though I like visiting himalayas in winters with 30-40% discounts in hotels and snowfalls to enjoy.From the scorching heat of chennai, I had been to Dalhousie.. via delhi. The trip from Delhi to Pathankot by Shalimar express, to say the least, was irritating. Despite traveling in a reserved coach, there was a maddening crowd getting in the compartment at all stations, forcing us to adjust seating with them (to the extent that 6 ppl were sitting in a 3-seat bay)..the journey was an ordeal till ambala station..In 1850, the spot where Dalhousie stands was a lovely nook at the foot of the Dhauladhar Rage. Against the backdrop of lofty snow-capped peaks, dense oak and pine groves covered the unbroken dopes of five hills. To this idyllic spot came a troubled man - Lord James Ramsay, Marquis of Dalhousie and Governor General of India. A continuing military campaign in the Punjab and the pressures of governance had ravaged his health, and he came to the hills in quest of some fleeting peace. He did not have to look far, and the place where he found his precious moments of serenity still bears his name.Dalhousie is a quiet town, with a sense of enchantment. It commands an imposing view, flanked as h is by mighty ranges to one side and the gentle valley of Chamba on the other. The climate is salubrious, and the settings just right for long walks or quiet getaways in the forest. Picturesque English cottages dot the town, imbuing it with an air of nostalgia akin to Shimla. More recently, the Tibetans, fleeing from Chinese occupation, have added their colorful presence to Dalhousie's much charm.Kasauli: I went to Kasauli with my friends from Delhi. We boarded a train from Delhi to Chandigarh and from there we hired a cab. It's a place must visit on a short trip. You may either pre-book an accommodation or book once you reach there. Being a tourist destination this place has ample hotels, resorts and lodges to stay. A hill station in Himachal Pradesh state, Kasauli is surrounded by hills. The place becomes even more beautiful during rainy season when clouds float in the city and over the hills. Once you are there, you should enjoy every sightseeing by walking rather than going by a vehicle.With the Almighty's grace, I have been able to enjoy a few trips.When I was in chandigarh I used to visit this  place  in 2-3 months.

Small market, my local Delhi market is bigger then thatPeople r nice n all but whatever, no fun nothing. Only 1 sight seeing pnt "Manki Point". Here also no cameras are allowed due to air force security.. what sort of tourism is that?Awesome outing in kasauli with my wife.

You can see the whole Chandigarh city from this point. But sadly you can’t carry your cameras, mobiles, pan drives & likewise items over there, as it is an air force area. And your one ID proof is also a must for entry just because of security issues. On Monkey Point there is Hanuman Mandir on the peak. People say that when Hanuman Ji was coming after taking Sanjivani Buti he left his foot sign there & that sign is still there & it is very big in size. And there is a Helipad on that footprint.

No more Honk !!! Honk !!! Honk !!! of buses & Traffic.Simply amazing nature with calm, mesmerizing atmosphere everywhere.Take Care,VanitaKasauli is a nature endowed beautiful hill station, but has its own story of shame. Its being RULED BY MILITARY. Law and Order is out of hands here, and into the hands of CORRUPT MILITARY PERSONS.Actually, I am living in Kalka and kasauli is only 24 km far from kalka. So it is very near from my city." Kasauli Castle Resort "I can best describe my stay at the Kasauli Castle resort as a nightmare which I would like to forget.Hangout is the name of the restaurant. It looked ordinary during the day when we checked in Kasauli Regency. The hotel was small but very good quality of rooms. Very comfortable jhoola hung from wall.I went to kasauli with my family and my friends family, idea was to have a good time with family so that kids can also relax.We booked Kasauli Castle for 3 nights and checked in on saturday noon, and was tehre till Sunday Morning .Due to a emergency at home we have to come back on Sunday itself so we asked the Kasauli Castle Management to check out and make our bill .Kimmughat is only three km before Kasauli on the main road. Just before kimmughat is the famous Souvenir and Gift Shop by the name of PINE KONEZ THE SOUVENIR SHOP & THE MUG STUDIO'You can do shopping of GIFTS of Kasauli and have YOUR HOLIDAY PICTURES PRINTED ON COFFEE MUGS AND T SHIRTS over here, latest attraction being the PHOTO MUGS on which you can get your photographs in kasauli printed in no time.However another road leads to Kasauli's lower mall from Kimmughat and measures only 1.0 KM. Kimmughat has come up with new Hotels and Resorts of all types, Guest houses to three star like Kasauli Regency, Kasauli castle, Kasauli woods, Laxmi Guest House and few others.Kasauli Regency's roof top open air restaurant, HANGOUT becomes lively in the evening with music, it has the looks of goa's famous shacks. People staying at Kimmughat love to walk till Kasauli through shortcut, which is motorable but nobody dares to drive on it, because of the steep gradient, very nice for a walk through the Pines to Kasauli's lower mall.Friends your trip to kasauli is incomplete without visiting the famous souvenir shop where you can do shopping of exclusive souvenirs of kasauli for your loved ones. Visiting here gives you a touch of European hill stations gift shops . It is just 2 kms before kasauli .Time: May end'08(3days/2nights)Kasauli is a nice place to visit if you want to relax for few days. there is nothing much to see or do. Just borad there enjoy green hills, walk on streets, sip tea coffee.We recently had a chance to visit Kasauli for a weekend around June end. To say the least the trip was wonderful as the place. In my view Kasauli must be the only real hill station left in India(a big thank you for to the Army authorities who maintain it).With a complete ban on commercial activity the place retains its old world charm. All of you who work very hard during the week can actually look forward to some real relaxation while in Kasuli.Before leaving book your Hotel. Alasia is recommended since it retains its old world charm.  This is must see place for all of you who can live in peace doing basically "nothing".Early morning walks are so much fun. One day walk till the Kasauli Resorts and may be have lunch there. The buffet is okay and in any case there is no other place to eat around it. Also try some local wines produced in the Shimla Hills, Shogi. Peach and Strawberry were quite good.My only request to the owners of Alasia, please do some well deserved maintenance to your Hotel in some places it si falling apart.Hey All, It was an amazing trip to Kasauli while goin to Simla after my marriage on 27th jan 2006. We enjoyed our honeymoon in Goa & I was having 2-3 days in hand before joining office. So we planned to go to Simla by car with my brother in law whoz married  has a lovely 1 yr old daughter.Its been long since I have written any review frankly I dint have time for it. My life was becoming very monotonous and the " work" was the only think I could think of. It was time that I decided boss this is too much and I had to take a break and the break come when I had to go Delhi due to some office work. I was so stressed that my 3 friends who are now settled in delhi suggested to go on a two day break . I thought why not I owe it to myself, one of my friend suggested KASAULI, the first thing that come to mind when he said this place was the movie 'Dil Chahata Hai' , this is the same place where akshay khanna goes away to.                   We took a flight o chandigarh from there we went by car which almost 3-3 1/2 hr. first the journey was very boring but then I started noticing these beautiful roads and the scenery surrounding it. It was breath taking.                 As soon as we reached we got accommodation in a local hotel and decided to rest for a while. I couldn't wait to explore this place. Our first trip was the main roads, there are  two main roads in kasauli one is the upper mall and the other is the lower mall. There are various shops here where one can shop. My friend says women can shop any where, its true I ended up buying a lot of stuff which was not needed but then I could stop myself. The scenery from the upper mall is superb the view is breath taking.  I the view of shimla is so beautiful that dont ask its like never seen before in the night especially the whole city lights up. You can see both chandigrah and shimla from the upper mall. There is this another destination called the monkey point I was told there is an temple there and best way to go is trek your way up and yes the experience was such I will not forget it for a life time.                The best way to explore this place is to walk it up those dont like it also can not resist this temptation yes the word is right this place will tempt u for an walk. There are not many places to see here but just exploring this place is enough . This place is so photogenic. There are huge oak trees and pine trees, this will remind you of the old hindi movies where the hero heroine are running around the trees.                         The food is also of here nothing much to be talked about, there are many restaurants and dhabas which you can choose from. At the end of the day all of us would sit by the fire outside in our hotel own and enjoy this beautiful view of this beautiful place with some wine,  oh god I wish I could do it again.                     On my last day here I got up early in the morning ti see the sun rise and the picture was so beautiful that even if I close my eyes  now I can still see and feel it.          I am mesmerized by this place I have fallen in love with this place. Please visit it it is you will love it.Nestled up at the foothills of the Himalayas, most people haven’t even heard of this beautiful holiday destination called Kasauli. Its about 3-3½ hr drive from Chandigarh and is about 3-4 hrs from Shimla.''Quaint'' - the word spontaneously sprung to my word as soon as we reached Kasauli.It was one wild plan started building at 1 AM of hot summer night of Delhi. We could not go to any place nearby like Agra and Jaipur etc due to heat, and other hill stations were too far off. We had 2 full days with us to make the trip. We thought to go to Shimla and started at 3 in the morning in my zen with full tank. We were 2 couples (unfortunately only one driver). We were driving in the empty roads of Delhi for exiting on NH towards Ambala. We took 30 minutes as opposed to 2 hours in the traffic. and then we were gliding on the NH at the average speed of 85-90 KMPH. It was a great drive. From the mid of our trip we spoke to one of our friend and he suggested us to stop over at Kasauli rather in Shimla. We reached Kasauli in straight 7 hours with one hours stop for food and drink etc.. We reached Kasauli without much info with us and looked for a hotel. It is a small hamlet town and most importantly it does not have the fancy hotels or restaurants and is not commercialised like other hill stations. There we found a small hotel which had neat and clean rooms (small sizes) with descent bathrooms. I must say it was hygienic and clean (but off course not fancy). we stayed in Kasauli for 2 days and enjoyed the beauty it possesses. It is one of the very good place to unwind and a place where you should go to relax. We made a quick trip to Chail and Shimla next day. It is most suited for a couple of days and is recommended for all.Its a beautiful destination for all but particularly for people living around Kasauli. We are from Chandigarh and go to hills for weekends quite often.Hi.. as said .. kasauli is a beautifull place for people who want secluded walks in the village. The cobbled paths, the mountain view and  the old charm has put an unforgettable picture in my mind. I had been to Kasauli around 5 yrs back for my honeymoon and although I was a little apprehensive about the place earlier ... it was the best stay thorught out our tour. Hotel Ros Common by HPTDC is a very good place in the surrounding with discounts available for off season bookings.I went there this winter in feburary. it is a hill station in himachal pradesh. it is a very charming little town about 12 kms from simla. 0ne feels at home the moment u arrive there, its so warm, not literally but u feel that way. it got a imperial flavour, which is very british I guess. its got lots of places to stay in. book earlier as it always has visiters. u can see the famous boarding sanavar from kasauli, if u like u can even to to it, its not very far. do take a trek to monkey point, although u wont find monkeys troubling u on the way, but go there before 4 as it shuts at 4p.m.the view fromthere is awesome, but u are not allowed to photograph there. also walk up to kushwant singhs house, there are beautiful cottage type house lined through the town. one can do a bit of shooping even here. theres a very famous shop called 'daily needs' try the sheek kababs there. although food is not too great in kasauli so pack up some ration before u gothere. maggi is easily available though, so that could come to your rescue, its lovely to eat maggi in these cold places. it is a very compact town, and people seem very helpful and friendly. so dont worry just unwind and have a great time.it is best suited for all.Well, to start with, this is one of the nearest hill stations that one can go to, in order to take a break from the hectic and busy lifestyles. And of course, Delhi's pollution!!!  It is a beautiful station to spend a weekend at. Its calm and serene environment makes you feel that you are high above where no pollution or crowds can disturb you. The chill of this place is so refreshing. And the view of the mist descending down on the road and the small little bridge(near the cafetaria) is fascinating. However, there is a dearth of hotels and restaurant in Kasuali. One could even do well with just one or two good hotels, not disturbing the air of the place...a good restaurant is also needed here! Because, when you go for a vacation with your family you want to enjoy every part of it from sightseeing to food to shopping to simply lazying around! One of the best parts of a trip to Kasuali, for me, is a meal at 'gyanni da dhaba'!!! One can reach this dhaba (which is like a decent-looking restaurant) by just going 1km straight on the highway rather than taking a left turn to Kasauli from the T-junc. It offers the best chicken & mutton curry that you could get in a hill station. The vegetarian food is awesome too! The service is prompt!When we were staying in Chandigarh for a year, we would take almost all our touring relatives to Kasuali. But now being back in Delhi, it feels like we should spend our time and money on a place which can offer more than Kasuali. Although the place is good when you are taking a week long break in an army guesthouse, like we did!There are a number of good writeups on Kasauli here and my idea in writing this  is just to complement  them  and to give certain tips which will be useful for people  going there on a weekend  trip.Travelog with pics-  kariyal.com/self/getthehellout/kasol/index.html   Munnar, a small hill station near cochin in kerala, is according to me the best hill station of india !! it is full of small n big waterfalls. There is also a small but very beautiful wild life sanctuary which is the last abode of the endangered Nilgiri goats. The last we heard about Kasauli was in the Hrithik Roshan starrer ?Koi Mil Gaya? where the most wanted alien ?Jadoo? landed. In March 1999, we had planned a trip to Kasauli where dad?s Company had a holiday home. After reaching New Delhi from Mumbai by Rajdhani Express, we boarded a Shatabdi Express to Chandigarh. There are many buses which ply between Chandigarh and Kasauli regularly. But we had the luxury of the holiday home Tata Sumo picking us up from the station. The driver was an elderly Sikh driver who insisted on being called Papaji. I have long promised my loved one that I shall take her out some time... we never managed to get leave together therefore we kept on waiting for an oppurtunity to go out and spend some good time together. Care to join me for a walk through the woods in Kasauli? Through desolate, virginal paths waiting to be explored, over the thick carpet of fallen pine needle leaves, strewn with fallen flowers, and dried pine fruits. If we are lucky enough we might just see a jungle cat or a jackal slinking away. Otherwise, birds are abundant and gamboling hares as well.Manali: Mashobra: Narkanda: Parwanoo: Anantnag: Gulmarg: Katra: Markha: Patnitop: Sonamarg: Udhampur: Zanskar: Deoghar: Dumka: Faridabad: I love travelling and always ready to see the amazing places and on my last vacation I visited the Faridabad city.and I had been there for more than 2 days and I like this city environment.Faridabad city is well known for the industrial center of India.Faridabad is good city, not a tourist place but have many things to see there.

I was trying to cover the kinnaur circuit via chitkul and than kapla. I started from delhi via shimla and reached sarahan. sarahan is a nice place to stay and the HPTDC hotel at sarahan is really good better than other HPTDC hotel. next day I went to chitkul but could not reach there because of snow. so same day I started for Kalpa. the kalpa is a nice place to stay. there are no of hotels including HPTDC. I decided to witness the first ray of sun on kinnaur kailash from my hotel and it was amazing. the snow peak was looking  yellow and orange. I recommend kalpa for family and friends. the place is  accessible and also availability of accommodation which make this place viable throughout year.The Kinner-Kailash range is silhouetted against the lovely town of Kalpa in Himachal Pradesh, the ancient capital of the Kinners of Kinnaur.Kufri: Kufri is located on the top of shimla. The place is so much beautiful and full of natural beauties. I visited kufri in december and it is the best time to visit because most of the times it is covered with snow.there u can take a horse ride and one person holds many horses.it is very beautiful when almost 50 horses walk in line.u will be shown many places while you are on the horses.u have to buy a ticket of 400 rupees for horse riding and horse is your for one hour.it is very crowded place.u can also buy various traditional items from there like himachali cap, wooden crafted items, shimla shawls etc. Important thing is that it is very peaceful and crimeless place. There is no problem for the stay as there are various hotels available. If any one willing to visit there I will highly recommend it, The best thing about the place is in evening time the beauty of thee place gets enhanced and it looks like a very romantic evening.Kufri is a hill station situated in upper shimla.if anybody wants to spend holidays in kufri november to febraury is the best time to visit because most of the times it is covered with snow.there u can take a horse ride and one person holds 3-4 horses.it is very beautiful when almost 50 horses walk in line.u will be shown many places while you are on the horses.u have to buy a ticket of 300 rupees for horse riding and horse is your for 1 hour.it is very crowded place.u can also buy various traditional items from there like himachali cap, wooden crafted items, shimla shawls etc. Hotels are also easily avaliable there.

The path is full of small rocks. You might get scared at some places as horses will walk on real corner of the path - but its safe as they know the way very well, they can even walk blindly I believe.;-) The destination you'll arrive at, is like a hill station, chilly weather and temples!I would like to tell you about some interesting things of Kufri.When I went to Shimla one shopkeeper told me to visit Kufri.I have visited many hill station in India but Kufri was a great experience. I have visited this place with my friends and I must say it was an amazing experience. The hills are too sharp and narrow and the loop kind of valley just take my breath away.I always love to travel in every vacation and the after the last semester exams my family planned to himach pradesh.and in winter I had been visited this place.this is near to shimla approx 10 KM from Shimla.by the time I visited the snow had fall two days back there.If you like horse-back riding, this place should be visited. The horses/mules will be trotting on the edge of the valley, and some people will get scared to death. But you have to trust those animals. They know how to walk, where to go, and which way.
